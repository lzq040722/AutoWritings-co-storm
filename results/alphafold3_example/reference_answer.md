## Overview of AlphaFold 3
AlphaFold 3, co-developed by Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs, was announced on May 8, 2024, and
represents a significant advancement in the prediction of biomolecular structures and interactions[2][7].
Unlike its predecessor, AlphaFold 2, AlphaFold 3 extends its capabilities beyond single-chain proteins
to a wide array of biomolecules including DNA, RNA, post-translational modifications, and small molecules
such as ligands, which are critical in drug discovery[1][2].
The AI model employs a neural network architecture that utilizes a custom Transformer with triangular
attention and a diffusion process to generate 3D coordinates of every atom within the specified
biomolecular system[6]. This allows researchers to input descriptions of complex biomolecular systems
and receive highly accurate predictions of their three-dimensional structures[6].
One of the standout features of AlphaFold 3 is its ability to predict the structures of protein
complexes with enhanced accuracy, particularly in protein-DNA and protein-RNA interactions. This

## Advancements in Biomolecular Structure Prediction
AlphaFold 3 represents a significant leap in the field of biomolecular structure prediction, building
upon the successes of its predecessor, AlphaFold 2. The new model boasts a substantially updated
diffusion-based architecture, which enables joint structure prediction of not only proteins but also
nucleic acids, small molecules, ions, and modified residues[8][38]. This expansion beyond proteins
marks a pivotal advancement, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of complex biomolecular
interactions and enhancing the accuracy of these predictions.
One of the most notable achievements of AlphaFold 3 is its improved accuracy, which far surpasses many
