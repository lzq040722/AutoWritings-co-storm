Almost all of these methods are also highly specialized to particular interaction types and cannot predict the structure of general biomolecular complexes containing many types of entities. Here we present AlphaFold 3 (AF3)\u2014a model that is capable of high-accuracy prediction of complexes containing nearly all molecular types present in the Protein Data Bank32 (PDB) (Fig.\n[2]: Update November 11, 2024: As of November 2024, we have released AlphaFold 3 model code and weights for academic use to help advance research. Learn more about AlphaFold tools. Original post: Inside every plant, animal and human cell are billions of molecular machines. They\u2019re made up of proteins, DNA and other molecules, but no single piece works on its own.\n[3]: AlphaFold has revealed millions of intricate 3D protein structures, and is helping scientists understand how all of life\u2019s molecules interact.\n[4]: And now there's a new version, AlphaFold 3, which promises even greater predictive abilities. To dive into the details of this upgrade, I'm joined by Ewen Callaway who has been writing about AlphaFold, well, basically since the beginning \u2014 for years now \u2014 and has been working on a new story about the latest iteration AlphaFold3.\n[5]: And how does it relate to AlphaFold? Because I would make an educated guess that sickle cell anemia therapy is a much older thing. ... It is slow, that's true. A lot of it is the glacial regulatory approval processes, e.g. without COVID we likely wouldn't have mRNA-based vaccines yet. But it's also that technology like gene editing is useless if you can't work out what edits to make.\n[6]: We love the excitement & results from the community on AlphaFold 3 and are doubling the AF Server daily job limit to 20. Happy to also share that we're working on releasing the AF3 model (incl weights) for academic use, which doesn\u2019t depend on our research infra, within 6 months.\u2014 Pushmeet Kohli (@pushmeet) May 13, 2024\n[7]: \u201cAny user who doesn't know how to code at all can just copy and paste the sequences of their proteins, DNA, RNA or the name of their small molecule, press a button and wait a few minutes. Their structure and the confidence metrics will come out so that they're able to look at and evaluate their prediction.\u201d \u00b7 In order to get AlphaFold 3 to work with this much wider range of biomolecules, the team vastly expanded the data that the newer model was trained on to include DNA, RNA, small molecules and more.\n[8]: Update November 11, 2024: As of November 2024, we have released AlphaFold 3 model code and weights for academic use to help advance research. Learn more about AlphaFold tools. ... Inside every plant, animal, and human cell are billions of molecular machines. They\u2019re made up of proteins, DNA, and other molecules, but no single piece works on its own.\n[9]: But while researchers have had difficulties finding qualified workers to carry out earlier-stage research, the technology may reduce that need. Rather than posing a threat to existing jobs, the AI program could become a pressure release valve for an area often stretched too thin, Bangert said. Given its potential in life science research, DeepMind and Isomorphic\u2019s CEO said this month the platform could eventually be a \u201cmulti-hundred billion\u201d dollar business. And while AlphaFold 3 could identify promising compounds faster, the usual hurdles to market will remain.\n[10]: 336 votes, 140 comments. The model itself is closed source and heavily restricted. Yes, the dataset of all known proteins is available, but Deepmind\u2026\n[11]: Instead, they got started on AlphaFold 3. This newer model, which the teams at Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs launched in May, builds on our previous models by predicting not just protein folding structures, but predicting the structure and interactions of all of life's molecules, including DNA, RNA and ligands (small molecules that bind to proteins).\n[12]: Deepmind\u2019s AlphaFold has revolutionized research by making it simple to predict the 3D structures of proteins, but it has lacked the ability to predict situations where a protein is bound to another molecule. Now, the AI has been upgraded to AlphaFold 3 and can accurately predict protein-molecule complexes containing DNA, RNA and more.\n[13]: This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback. The artificial intelligence program AlphaFold 3, rolled out by Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs earlier this month, has been called \u201cgroundbreaking,\u201d holding transformative potential in drug discovery.\n[14]: Hassabis and Jumper had previously won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2023 for their leadership of the AlphaFold project. Proteins consist of chains of amino acids which spontaneously fold to form the three dimensional (3-D) structures of the proteins. The 3-D structure is crucial to understanding the biological function of the protein.\n[15]: The first version of the technology was released in 2018, but it was 2020\u2019s AlphaFold 2 that made headlines \u2013 winning the prestigious Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) 14 competition. Having gone through multiple major iterations, the most recent release, AlphaFold 3, is set to further transform the protein space.\n[16]: When AlphaFold 3 debuted in May, DeepMind\u2019s decision to withhold the code while offering limited access through a web interface drew criticism from researchers. The controversy exposed a key challenge in AI research: how to balance open science with commercial interests, particularly as companies like DeepMind\u2019s sister organization Isomorphic Labs work to develop new drugs using these advances.\n[17]: Author links open overlay panelToni K.

Almost all of these methods are also highly specialized to particular interaction types and cannot predict the structure of general biomolecular complexes containing many types of entities. Here we present AlphaFold 3 (AF3)\\u2014a model that is capable of high-accuracy prediction of complexes containing nearly all molecular types present in the Protein Data Bank32 (PDB) (Fig.\\n[2]: Update November 11, 2024: As of November 2024, we have released AlphaFold 3 model code and weights for academic use to help advance research. Learn more about AlphaFold tools. Original post: Inside every plant, animal and human cell are billions of molecular machines. They\\u2019re made up of proteins, DNA and other molecules, but no single piece works on its own.\\n[3]: AlphaFold has revealed millions of intricate 3D protein structures, and is helping scientists understand how all of life\\u2019s molecules interact.\\n[4]: And now there's a new version, AlphaFold 3, which promises even greater predictive abilities. To dive into the details of this upgrade, I'm joined by Ewen Callaway who has been writing about AlphaFold, well, basically since the beginning \\u2014 for years now \\u2014 and has been working on a new story about the latest iteration AlphaFold3.\\n[5]: And how does it relate to AlphaFold? Because I would make an educated guess that sickle cell anemia therapy is a much older thing. ... It is slow, that's true. A lot of it is the glacial regulatory approval processes, e.g. without COVID we likely wouldn't have mRNA-based vaccines yet. But it's also that technology like gene editing is useless if you can't work out what edits to make.\\n[6]: We love the excitement & results from the community on AlphaFold 3 and are doubling the AF Server daily job limit to 20. Happy to also share that we're working on releasing the AF3 model (incl weights) for academic use, which doesn\\u2019t depend on our research infra, within 6 months.\\u2014 Pushmeet Kohli (@pushmeet) May 13, 2024\\n[7]: \\u201cAny user who doesn't know how to code at all can just copy and paste the sequences of their proteins, DNA, RNA or the name of their small molecule, press a button and wait a few minutes.

Rather than posing a threat to existing jobs, the AI program could become a pressure release valve for an area often stretched too thin, Bangert said. Given its potential in life science research, DeepMind and Isomorphic\\u2019s CEO said this month the platform could eventually be a \\u201cmulti-hundred billion\\u201d dollar business. And while AlphaFold 3 could identify promising compounds faster, the usual hurdles to market will remain.\\n[10]: 336 votes, 140 comments. The model itself is closed source and heavily restricted. Yes, the dataset of all known proteins is available, but Deepmind\\u2026\\n[11]: Instead, they got started on AlphaFold 3. This newer model, which the teams at Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs launched in May, builds on our previous models by predicting not just protein folding structures, but predicting the structure and interactions of all of life's molecules, including DNA, RNA and ligands (small molecules that bind to proteins).\\n[12]: Deepmind\\u2019s AlphaFold has revolutionized research by making it simple to predict the 3D structures of proteins, but it has lacked the ability to predict situations where a protein is bound to another molecule. Now, the AI has been upgraded to AlphaFold 3 and can accurately predict protein-molecule complexes containing DNA, RNA and more.\\n[13]: This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback. The artificial intelligence program AlphaFold 3, rolled out by Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs earlier this month, has been called \\u201cgroundbreaking,\\u201d holding transformative potential in drug discovery.\\n[14]: Hassabis and Jumper had previously won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2023 for their leadership of the AlphaFold project. Proteins consist of chains of amino acids which spontaneously fold to form the three dimensional (3-D) structures of the proteins. The 3-D structure is crucial to understanding the biological function of the protein.\\n[15]: The first version of the technology was released in 2018, but it was 2020\\u2019s AlphaFold 2 that made headlines \\u2013 winning the prestigious Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) 14 competition. Having gone through multiple major iterations, the most recent release, AlphaFold 3, is set to further transform the protein space.\\n[16]: When AlphaFold 3 debuted in May, DeepMind\\u2019s decision to withhold the code while offering limited access through a web interface drew criticism from researchers. The controversy exposed a key challenge in AI research: how to balance open science with commercial interests, particularly as companies like DeepMind\\u2019s sister organization Isomorphic Labs work to develop new drugs using these advances.\\n[17]: Author links open overlay panelToni K.

Leveraging advanced deep learning methodologies, AlphaFold 3 has achieved unprecedented accuracy in predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins, a cornerstone in understanding biomolecular interactions and functions . This capability not only enhances our grasp of biological machinery but also accelerates the pace at which we can address some of the most pressing challenges in medical biology, from antibiotic resistance to the development of malaria vaccines .\n[2]: In order to get AlphaFold 3 to work with this much wider range of biomolecules, the team vastly expanded the data that the newer model was trained on to include DNA, RNA, small molecules and more. \u201cWe were able to say, \u2018Let's just train on everything that exists in this dataset that helped us so much with proteins and let\u2019s see how far we can get,\u2019\u201d Lindsay says.\n[3]: On 15 July 2021, the AlphaFold 2 paper was published in Nature as an advance access publication alongside open source software and a searchable database of species proteomes. As of February 2025, the paper had been cited nearly 32,000 times. AlphaFold 3 was announced on 8 May 2024. It can predict the structure of complexes created by proteins with DNA, RNA, various ligands, and ions. The new prediction method shows a minimum 50% improvement in accuracy for protein interactions with other molecules compared to existing methods.\n[4]: It gained notoriety for its performance in the CASP 14 competition, where it significantly outperformed other methods, demonstrating the potential of powerful AI in solving a decades-long challenge.

However, John Jumper, PhD, one of the senior authors of the AlphaFold 3 article and lead author on AlphaFold 2, reportedly told the press that DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs had consulted more than 50 experts in biosecurity, bioethics, and AI safety and concluded that AlphaFold 3\u2019s marginal biosecurity risks were far outweighed by the system\u2019s potential benefits to science.\n[4]: Researchers and policymakers must work together to establish guidelines and regulations that mitigate the risks associated with the misuse of AlphaFold 3.

That shift led to a new issue, though: Since so-called \u201cdisordered regions\u201d of proteins weren\u2019t included in the training data, the diffusion model would try to create an inaccurate \u201cordered\u201d structure with a defined spiral shape, instead of predicting disordered regions.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\n\nNow give your response.

                "content": "The advent of AlphaFold 3 has brought about a significant advancement in the field of scientific research, particularly in predicting the structure and interactions of various molecules[9]. While the potential benefits of this technology are immense, there are also ethical concerns that need to be addressed, especially in terms of data privacy and biases in predictions[5].\n\nOne of the primary ethical concerns surrounding AlphaFold 3 is the limited and proprietary nature of its accessibility[2]. This raises questions about equitable access to cutting-edge technology and the impact on scientific transparency and public accountability. While the software is accessible through the AlphaFold Server for global non-commercial research, it is not open-sourced like its predecessors[5]. This restricted access could potentially hinder the democratization of scientific research and limit the benefits of this revolutionary technology to a broader spectrum of the scientific community.\n\nMoreover, the potential for biases in AI models, including AlphaFold 3, poses another ethical challenge[5]. As with any AI technology, there is a risk of introducing biases into predictions, which could have far-reaching implications in scientific research and decision-making processes. Addressing these biases and ensuring the accuracy and fairness of predictions generated by AlphaFold 3 are crucial steps in maximizing its potential benefits while minimizing potential harms.\n\nIn addition, the issue of data privacy comes to the forefront when considering the use of AlphaFold 3 in scientific research[11]. Independently reproducing the model could be valuable for training new variants, potentially on private data repositories[11]. This raises concerns about the privacy and security of sensitive data used in training and validating AI models like AlphaFold 3. Establishing clear guidelines and regulations to safeguard data privacy and prevent misuse of the technology is essential in harnessing its full potential for scientific advancement.\n\nOverall, while AlphaFold 3 holds great promise in transforming medical science and research, it is imperative to address the ethical concerns surrounding its use, particularly in terms of data privacy and biases in predictions. By promoting ethical research practices, ensuring equitable access to the technology, and mitigating potential risks, researchers and policymakers can harness the full potential of AlphaFold 3 while upholding ethical standards in scientific research[4].",

Superior in accuracy and more powerful than its predecessor AlphaFold 2, this innovation has astonished the world with its capacity and speed.\n[2]: AlphaFold uses a neural network approach that directly predicts the 3D coordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms for a given protein using the protein sequence and sequence homology. While immediately being the best prediction method in CASP13, it was still not good enough to call the protein structure prediction task successful. A successful in silico prediction method reaches experimental accuracy.\n[3]: Statistical significance values (Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test) were calculated between interface energy scores for sets of cases with incorrect versus medium and incorrect versus high CAPRI accuracy predictions, as noted at top (**p \u2264 0.01). Recently, an updated version of AlphaFold (v.2.3.0, hereafter denoted as v.2.3) was released, with modifications to the pipeline and deep learning model (DeepMind, 2022). Compared with the previous version, this version was trained on PDB structures released until September 30, 2021, resulting in a 30% increase in training data.\n[4]: Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1\u20134, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure.\n[5]: AlphaFold-latest, the next generation of AlphaFold, has the ability to predict the structure of almost all biomolecules along with proteins compared to previous models. The model can predict a variety of molecular combinations, including protein-nucleic acid complexes and protein-small molecule complexes, and shows higher prediction accuracy than traditional docking programs.\n[6]: Artificial Intelligence (AI) took the structural biology world by storm when Google parent company Alphabet\u2019s DeepMind AlphaFold software was released in 2021. It was a major breakthrough in three-dimensional protein structure prediction, promising highly accurate models for proteins of unknown conformation.\n[7]: Furthermore, detailed analysis was conducted on the impact of recycling iterations, as well as the use of custom template inputs to evaluate the impact of accurate subunit modeling on antibody-antigen complex modeling accuracy. Finally, we benchmarked a recently released version of AlphaFold (v.2.3) and compared its performance to that of the previous version (v.2.2). Our study presents a thorough analysis of AlphaFold\u2019s ability to predict antibody-antigen complexes, yielding valuable insights for interpreting model accuracy, identifying obstacles in the modeling process, and highlighting potential areas for improvement.\n[8]: For the interactions of proteins with other molecule types we see at least a 50% improvement compared with existing prediction methods, and for some important categories of interaction we have doubled prediction accuracy. We hope AlphaFold 3 will help transform our understanding of the biological world and drug discovery.\n[9]: Measured by the root-mean-square deviation (RMS-D) of the placement of the alpha-carbon atoms of the protein backbone chain, which tends to be dominated by the performance of the worst-fitted outliers, 88% of AlphaFold 2's predictions had an RMS deviation of less than 4 \u00c5 for the set of overlapped C-alpha atoms. 76% of predictions achieved better than 3 \u00c5, and 46% had a C-alpha atom RMS accuracy better than 2 \u00c5, with a median RMS deviation in its predictions of 2.1 \u00c5 for a set of overlapped CA atoms.\n[10]: For years, scientists have been attempting to integrate the latest and greatest AI models into the field, in order to speed up the process and improve accuracy.

We have fine-tuned new AlphaFold-Multimer weights using identical model architecture but a new training cutoff of 2021-09-30.

The accuracies of these predictions vary, however, and they do not take into account ligands, covalent modifications or other environmental factors.\\n[7]: The latest release of DeepMind\\u2019s AlphaFold 3 (AF3) represents a monumental stride in the domain of protein structure prediction, establishing new paradigms in accuracy and applicability that far\\u2026\\n[8]: DeepMind\\u2019s AlphaFold3 webserver offers exciting new opportunities to make structural predictions of heterogeneous macromolecular systems. Here we attempt to apply AlphaFold3 to large RNA molecules whose 3D atomic structures are unknown but whose physical dimensions have been studied experimentally.\\n[9]: The small fraction of residues with predictions under 80 may lead to some uncertainty in the error estimates for moderate- and low-confidence predictions in Table 1. The median r.m.s.d. between AlphaFold predictions and deposited models in the PDB in our analysis (1.0 \\u00c5; Fig. 2c) was considerably lower than that obtained in a large-scale analysis of recent structures by DeepMind1 (2.3 \\u00c5 for all C\\u03b1 atoms, 1.5 \\u00c5 excluding the largest 5% of differences), perhaps due to the high confidence in prediction in our sample.\\n[10]: The complexity of drug interactions and physiological responses often requires more than accurate structural predictions to achieve effective therapeutic results . ... The limited and proprietary nature of AlphaFold's accessibility raises concerns regarding equitable access to cutting-edge technology. Such restrictions can impact scientific transparency and public accountability, which are crucial for the advancement and democratization of scientific research .\\n[11]: Due to the difficulty of determining protein structures by experimental methods, their predictions have been one of the central problems of the scientific community.

This newer model, which the teams at Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs launched in May, builds on our previous models by predicting not just protein folding structures, but predicting the structure and interactions of all of life's molecules, including DNA, RNA and ligands (small molecules that bind to proteins). \\u201cWith AlphaFold 2, we made enormous progress on this decades-old open problem of protein folding, but if you look at recent high-impact research, researchers are moving beyond that,\\u201d says Jonas Adler, research scientist at Google DeepMind.\\n[13]: We\\u2019ll also be expanding our free AlphaFold education online course with EMBL-EBI and partnerships with organizations in the Global South to equip scientists with the tools they need to accelerate adoption and research, including on underfunded areas such as neglected diseases and food security. We\\u2019ll continue to work with the scientific community and policy makers to develop and deploy AI technologies responsibly. 7BBV - Enzyme: AlphaFold 3\\u2019s prediction for a molecular complex featuring an enzyme protein (blue), an ion (yellow sphere) and simple sugars (yellow), along with the true structure (gray).\\n[14]: The authors thank members of the Elcock group for their help with performing predictions on the AlphaFold3 webserver and the reviewers of this manuscript for a number of insightful comments.

One key aspect that sets AlphaFold 3 apart from its previous versions is its enhanced data training methods. AlphaFold 3 utilizes a neural network approach to directly predict the 3D coordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms for a given protein, using the protein sequence and sequence homology [32]. This updated version of AlphaFold was trained on a significantly larger dataset, including DNA, RNA, small molecules, and more, in order to expand its capabilities to predict the structures of a wider range of biomolecules [37].\n\nIn terms of predictive accuracy, AlphaFold 3 has shown remarkable advancements. The model can now predict the structure of almost all biomolecules, including protein-nucleic acid complexes and protein-small molecule complexes, with higher accuracy compared to traditional docking programs [34]. In interactions of proteins with other molecule types, AlphaFold 3 has demonstrated at least a 50% improvement over existing prediction methods, doubling prediction accuracy in some important categories of interaction [35]. Additionally, when measured by the root-mean-square deviation (RMS-D) of the placement of alpha-carbon atoms of the protein backbone chain, AlphaFold 3 has achieved impressive results, with a significant percentage of predictions achieving high accuracy levels [36].\n\nWhile previous versions of AlphaFold have also been highly successful, AlphaFold 3's advancements in data training methods and predictive accuracy have positioned it as a cutting-edge tool in the field of biomolecular structure prediction. The continued evolution of AlphaFold technology holds great promise for transforming our understanding of the biological world and enhancing drug discovery efforts [35].",

One key aspect that sets AlphaFold 3 apart from its previous versions is its enhanced data training methods. AlphaFold 3 utilizes a neural network approach to directly predict the 3D coordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms for a given protein, using the protein sequence and sequence homology [32]. This updated version of AlphaFold was trained on a significantly larger dataset, including DNA, RNA, small molecules, and more, in order to expand its capabilities to predict the structures of a wider range of biomolecules [37].\n\nIn terms of predictive accuracy, AlphaFold 3 has shown remarkable advancements. The model can now predict the structure of almost all biomolecules, including protein-nucleic acid complexes and protein-small molecule complexes, with higher accuracy compared to traditional docking programs [34]. In interactions of proteins with other molecule types, AlphaFold 3 has demonstrated at least a 50% improvement over existing prediction methods, doubling prediction accuracy in some important categories of interaction [35]. Additionally, when measured by the root-mean-square deviation (RMS-D) of the placement of alpha-carbon atoms of the protein backbone chain, AlphaFold 3 has achieved impressive results, with a significant percentage of predictions achieving high accuracy levels [36].\n\nWhile previous versions of AlphaFold have also been highly successful, AlphaFold 3's advancements in data training methods and predictive accuracy have positioned it as a cutting-edge tool in the field of biomolecular structure prediction. The continued evolution of AlphaFold technology holds great promise for transforming our understanding of the biological world and enhancing drug discovery efforts [35].\n\nNow give engaging question only.\nQuestion:",

One key aspect that sets AlphaFold 3 apart from its previous versions is its enhanced data training methods. AlphaFold 3 utilizes a neural network approach to directly predict the 3D coordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms for a given protein, using the protein sequence and sequence homology [32]. This updated version of AlphaFold was trained on a significantly larger dataset, including DNA, RNA, small molecules, and more, in order to expand its capabilities to predict the structures of a wider range of biomolecules [37].\\n\\nIn terms of predictive accuracy, AlphaFold 3 has shown remarkable advancements. The model can now predict the structure of almost all biomolecules, including protein-nucleic acid complexes and protein-small molecule complexes, with higher accuracy compared to traditional docking programs [34]. In interactions of proteins with other molecule types, AlphaFold 3 has demonstrated at least a 50% improvement over existing prediction methods, doubling prediction accuracy in some important categories of interaction [35]. Additionally, when measured by the root-mean-square deviation (RMS-D) of the placement of alpha-carbon atoms of the protein backbone chain, AlphaFold 3 has achieved impressive results, with a significant percentage of predictions achieving high accuracy levels [36].\\n\\nWhile previous versions of AlphaFold have also been highly successful, AlphaFold 3's advancements in data training methods and predictive accuracy have positioned it as a cutting-edge tool in the field of biomolecular structure prediction. The continued evolution of AlphaFold technology holds great promise for transforming our understanding of the biological world and enhancing drug discovery efforts [35].\\n\\nNow give engaging question only.\\nQuestion:\"}]}"

One key aspect that sets AlphaFold 3 apart from its previous versions is its enhanced data training methods. AlphaFold 3 utilizes a neural network approach to directly predict the 3D coordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms for a given protein, using the protein sequence and sequence homology [32]. This updated version of AlphaFold was trained on a significantly larger dataset, including DNA, RNA, small molecules, and more, in order to expand its capabilities to predict the structures of a wider range of biomolecules [37].\\n\\nIn terms of predictive accuracy, AlphaFold 3 has shown remarkable advancements. The model can now predict the structure of almost all biomolecules, including protein-nucleic acid complexes and protein-small molecule complexes, with higher accuracy compared to traditional docking programs [34]. In interactions of proteins with other molecule types, AlphaFold 3 has demonstrated at least a 50% improvement over existing prediction methods, doubling prediction accuracy in some important categories of interaction [35]. Additionally, when measured by the root-mean-square deviation (RMS-D) of the placement of alpha-carbon atoms of the protein backbone chain, AlphaFold 3 has achieved impressive results, with a significant percentage of predictions achieving high accuracy levels [36].\\n\\nWhile previous versions of AlphaFold have also been highly successful, AlphaFold 3's advancements in data training methods and predictive accuracy have positioned it as a cutting-edge tool in the field of biomolecular structure prediction. The continued evolution of AlphaFold technology holds great promise for transforming our understanding of the biological world and enhancing drug discovery efforts [35].\\n\\nNow give engaging question only.\\nQuestion: How has the latest version of AlphaFold, AlphaFold 3, revolutionized the field of biomolecular structure prediction?\\n\\nNow give engaging answer only with all inline citations from original text.\\nAnswer:\"}]}"

By leveraging AlphaFold 3's advancements in biomolecular structure prediction, protein engineers can accelerate the process of designing custom proteins tailored for specific applications in biotechnology, medicine, and other fields .\n\nGathered information:\n[1]: Leveraging advanced deep learning methodologies, AlphaFold 3 has achieved unprecedented accuracy in predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins, a cornerstone in understanding biomolecular interactions and functions . This capability not only enhances our grasp of biological machinery but also accelerates the pace at which we can address some of the most pressing challenges in medical biology, from antibiotic resistance to the development of malaria vaccines .\n[2]: On this subset of 100 cases, the use of default templates identified from the AlphaFold pipeline resulted in 18% success in generating near\u2010native (medium or high accuracy) top\u2010ranked predictions (Figure 5a), which is similar to the performance on the full benchmark (Figure 1a). ... Improved subunit modeling enhances antibody\u2013antigen complex modeling success.\n[3]: This creates a strong bias for atoms to be correct relative to the local frame of each residue and hence correct with respect to its side-chain interactions, as well as providing the main source of chirality for AlphaFold (Supplementary Methods 1.9.3 and Supplementary Fig. 9). The AlphaFold architecture is able to train to high accuracy using only supervised learning on PDB data, but we are able to enhance accuracy (Fig. 4a) using an approach similar to noisy student self-distillation35. In this procedure, we use a trained network to predict the structure of around 350,000 diverse sequences from Uniclust3036 and make a new dataset of predicted structures filtered to a high-confidence subset.\n[4]: For the interactions of proteins with other molecule types we see at least a 50% improvement compared with existing prediction methods, and for some important categories of interaction we have doubled prediction accuracy. We hope AlphaFold 3 will help transform our understanding of the biological world and drug discovery.\n[5]: The introduction of AlphaFold 21 has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and design2,3,4,5,6. Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein\u2013ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody\u2013antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8.\n[6]: By incorporating these training enhancements, AlphaFold 3 takes a significant step forward in generating reliable and biologically meaningful structure predictions. AlphaFold 3\u2019s remarkable ability to predict the interactions between proteins and small molecules holds immense promise for revolutionizing drug discovery. The paper highlights that \u201cAF3 shows far greater accuracy on protein-ligand interactions than state-of-the-art docking tools,\u201d suggesting that the model can reliably predict the binding sites and optimal shapes for potential drug molecules.\n[7]: Generalizability Across Biomolecular Complexes: The system can now predict structures of complexes involving not just proteins but also nucleic acids, small molecules, ions, and modified residues. This broadens its applicability to almost all molecular types found in the Protein Data Bank. Accuracy and Performance: AlphaFold 3 exhibits enhanced accuracy in predicting protein-ligand interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and antibody-antigen interactions.\n[8]: Measured by the root-mean-square deviation (RMS-D) of the placement of the alpha-carbon atoms of the protein backbone chain, which tends to be dominated by the performance of the worst-fitted outliers, 88% of AlphaFold 2's predictions had an RMS deviation of less than 4 \u00c5 for the set of overlapped C-alpha atoms. 76% of predictions achieved better than 3 \u00c5, and 46% had a C-alpha atom RMS accuracy better than 2 \u00c5, with a median RMS deviation in its predictions of 2.1 \u00c5 for a set of overlapped CA atoms.\n[9]: Google DeepMind's AlphaFold 3 improves drug discovery by predicting complex protein interactions and structures with high accuracy.\n[10]: One of the most notable advancements in AlphaFold 3 is its expanded predictive abilities. The model now accurately predicts protein-molecule complexes that include a variety of biomolecules such as DNA and RNA. This expansion is crucial for applications in genomics research and drug discovery, providing researchers with a powerful tool for faster and more accurate predictions.\n[11]: Google DeepMind Technologies Limited (London, United Kingdom) recently released its new version of the biomolecular structure predictor artificial intelligence (AI) model named AlphaFold 3. Superior in accuracy and more powerful than its predecessor AlphaFold 2, this innovation has astonished the world with its capacity and speed.\n[12]: We also participated in community-wide forums and discussions ahead of AlphaFold 3\u2019s launch.

Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues.\n[2]: Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1\u20134, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure.\n[3]: AlphaFold 3 predicts the structure and interactions of all of life\u2019s molecules\n[4]: For this, ESM Metagenomic Atlas is an important 3D protein structures resource to be deeply investigated by the scientific community (Lin et al., 2022). Finally, the efforts to better predict how mutations affect protein structure using these new approaches are essential to gain insights in human genetic disease and further improve disease management and prediction. Today, these methods do not outperform AlphaFold2, but with the improvement of deep language models and the enrichment of these models with biological information through multi-task learning, they promise to revolutionize the protein structural biology.\n[5]: By providing detailed insights into how molecules interact and influence biological functions, it paves the way for groundbreaking advancements in medical science and research . ... AlphaFold 3 represents a significant evolution from its predecessor, AlphaFold 2, primarily through its advanced architectural framework . The core of this new model, the Evoformer module, has been significantly enhanced to improve performance across a broader spectrum of biomolecules, extending beyond proteins to include DNA, RNA, and ligands . This architectural refinement has enabled AlphaFold 3 to achieve unprecedented accuracy in predicting drug-like interactions, setting a new benchmark in the field .\n[6]: Advancing our knowledge of such immune-system processes helps better understand coronaviruses, including COVID-19, raising possibilities for improved treatments. Given an input list of molecules, AlphaFold 3 generates their joint 3D structure, revealing how they all fit together. It models large biomolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA, as well as small molecules, also known as ligands \u2014 a category encompassing many drugs. Furthermore, AlphaFold 3 can model chemical modifications to these molecules which control the healthy functioning of cells, that when disrupted can lead to disease.\n[7]: The inclusion of metagenomic data has improved the quality of the prediction of MSAs. One of the biggest sources of the training data was the custom-built Big Fantastic Database (BFD) of 65,983,866 protein families, represented as MSAs and hidden Markov models (HMMs), covering 2,204,359,010 protein sequences from reference databases, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes. AlphaFold 2's results at CASP14 were described as \"astounding\" and \"transformational\".\n[8]: Instead, they got started on AlphaFold 3. This newer model, which the teams at Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs launched in May, builds on our previous models by predicting not just protein folding structures, but predicting the structure and interactions of all of life's molecules, including DNA, RNA and ligands (small molecules that bind to proteins).\n[9]: Breakthrough achievements in protein structure prediction have occurred recently, mostly due to the advent of sophisticated machine learning methods and significant advancements in algorithmic approaches. The most recent version of the AlphaFold model, known as \u201cAlphaFold-latest,\u201d which expands the functionalities of the groundbreaking AlphaFold2, is the subject of this article.\n[10]: Isomorphic Labs is using AlphaFold 3 to accelerate and improve the success of drug design \u2014 by helping understand how to approach new disease targets, and developing novel ways to pursue existing ones that were previously out of reach. 8AW3 - RNA modifying protein: AlphaFold 3\u2019s prediction for a molecular complex featuring a protein (blue), a strand of RNA (purple), and two ions (yellow) closely matches the true structure (gray).\n[11]: In this context, studies have emerged to predict protein structures by methods based on a template or free modeling. In the last years, different methods have been combined to overcome their individual limitations, until the emergence of AlphaFold2, which demonstrated that predicting protein structure with high accuracy at unprecedented scale is possible.\n[12]: Google DeepMind Technologies Limited (London, United Kingdom) recently released its new version of the biomolecular structure predictor artificial intelligence (AI) model named AlphaFold 3. Superior in accuracy and more powerful than its predecessor AlphaFold 2, this innovation has astonished the world with its capacity and speed. It takes humans years to determine the structure of various proteins and how the shape works with the receptors but AlphaFold 3 predicts the same structure in seconds.\n[13]: Accurate predictions of the three-dimensional structures of proteins from their amino acid sequences have come of age. AlphaFold, a deep learning-based approach to protein structure prediction, shows remarkable success in independent assessments of prediction accuracy.\n[14]: AlphaFold2 also computed how much to trust its predictions, and these confidence ratings allowed the researchers to squeeze more information from the available data and thus, to enhance its performance. After they fed it the roughly 140,000 PDB sequences, they ran another set whose structures had not been solved.\n[15]: Proteins underpin every biological process, in every living thing. Made from long chains of amino acids, each has a unique complex 3D structure. But figuring out just one of these can take several years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Proteins consist of chains of amino acids which spontaneously fold to form the three dimensional (3-D) structures of the proteins.\n[3]: Thanks to AlphaFold, startups with roughly $5\u201310 million in VC funding have \u201ca realistic chance at developing a new drug,\u201d which can be sufficient to cover the costs of infrastructure, talent acquisition and initial research. But Big Pharma companies tend to accumulate vast datasets over the years while forging partnerships with organizations.\n[4]: We also participated in community-wide forums and discussions ahead of AlphaFold 3\u2019s launch. AlphaFold Server reflects our ongoing commitment to share the benefits of AlphaFold, including our free database of 200 million protein structures. We\u2019ll also be expanding our free AlphaFold education online course with EMBL-EBI and partnerships with organizations in the Global South to equip scientists with the tools they need to accelerate adoption and research, including on underfunded areas such as neglected diseases and food security.\n[5]: We are reimagining the entire drug discovery process from first principles with an AI-first approach.\n[6]: @article{Abramson2024-fj, title = \"Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with {AlphaFold} 3\", author = \"Abramson, Josh and Adler, Jonas and Dunger, Jack and Evans, Richard and Green, Tim and Pritzel, Alexander and Ronneberger, Olaf and Willmore, Lindsay and Ballard, Andrew J and Bambrick, Joshua and Bodenstein, Sebastian W and Evans, David A and Hung, Chia-Chun and O'Neill, Michael and Reiman, David and Tunyasuvunakool, Kathryn and Wu, Zachary and {\\v Z}emgulyt{\\.e}, Akvil{\\.e} and Arvaniti, Eirini and Beattie, Charles and Bertolli, Ottavia and Bridgland, Alex and Cherepan\n[7]: This package provides an implementation of the inference pipeline of AlphaFold 3. See below for how to access the model parameters. You may only use AlphaFold 3 model parameters if received directly from Google.\n[8]: The withholding of the code was largely down to commercial reasons, as co-developer Isomorphic Labs, a DeepMind spinoff company, is using AlphaFold3 internally to speed up its drug discovery efforts. The company currently has partnerships potentially worth $3 billion with Eli Lilly and Novartis aimed at developing multiple drugs.\n[9]: This capability is instrumental in advancing our understanding of how diseases like COVID-19 can be combated through the immune system, potentially leading to more effective treatments and vaccines . By modeling these interactions with high accuracy, AlphaFold 3 aids in the development of therapeutic strategies that are finely tuned to the nuances of immune system behavior .\n[10]: We hope AlphaFold 3 will help transform our understanding of the biological world and drug discovery. Scientists can access the majority of its capabilities, for free, through our newly launched AlphaFold Server, an easy-to-use research tool.\n[11]: Made from long chains of amino acids, each has a unique complex 3D structure. But figuring out just one of these can take several years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars. In 2020, AlphaFold solved this problem, with the ability to predict protein structures in minutes, to a remarkable degree of accuracy.\n[12]: In order to get AlphaFold 3 to work with this much wider range of biomolecules, the team vastly expanded the data that the newer model was trained on to include DNA, RNA, small molecules and more. \u201cWe were able to say, \u2018Let's just train on everything that exists in this dataset that helped us so much with proteins and let\u2019s see how far we can get,\u2019\u201d Lindsay says.\n[13]: The introduction of AlphaFold 21 has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and design2\u20136. Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues.\n[14]: AlphaFold 3 predicts the structure and interactions of all of life\u2019s molecules\n[15]: Could you just tell me how it binds the DNA?\u201d John Jumper, a director at Google DeepMind, said during a press conference. Unlike past versions, AlphaFold 3, which was codeveloped with drug company Isomorphic Labs and first announced in October, can tackle such interactions.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational and concise\n\nNow give your response.

You may only use AlphaFold 3 model parameters if received directly from Google.\\n[8]: The withholding of the code was largely down to commercial reasons, as co-developer Isomorphic Labs, a DeepMind spinoff company, is using AlphaFold3 internally to speed up its drug discovery efforts. The company currently has partnerships potentially worth $3 billion with Eli Lilly and Novartis aimed at developing multiple drugs.\\n[9]: This capability is instrumental in advancing our understanding of how diseases like COVID-19 can be combated through the immune system, potentially leading to more effective treatments and vaccines . By modeling these interactions with high accuracy, AlphaFold 3 aids in the development of therapeutic strategies that are finely tuned to the nuances of immune system behavior .\\n[10]: We hope AlphaFold 3 will help transform our understanding of the biological world and drug discovery. Scientists can access the majority of its capabilities, for free, through our newly launched AlphaFold Server, an easy-to-use research tool.\\n[11]: Made from long chains of amino acids, each has a unique complex 3D structure. But figuring out just one of these can take several years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars. In 2020, AlphaFold solved this problem, with the ability to predict protein structures in minutes, to a remarkable degree of accuracy.\\n[12]: In order to get AlphaFold 3 to work with this much wider range of biomolecules, the team vastly expanded the data that the newer model was trained on to include DNA, RNA, small molecules and more. \\u201cWe were able to say, \\u2018Let's just train on everything that exists in this dataset that helped us so much with proteins and let\\u2019s see how far we can get,\\u2019\\u201d Lindsay says.\\n[13]: The introduction of AlphaFold 21 has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and design2\\u20136. Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues.\\n[14]: AlphaFold 3 predicts the structure and interactions of all of life\\u2019s molecules\\n[15]: Could you just tell me how it binds the DNA?\\u201d John Jumper, a director at Google DeepMind, said during a press conference. Unlike past versions, AlphaFold 3, which was codeveloped with drug company Isomorphic Labs and first announced in October, can tackle such interactions.\\n\\nStyle of your response should be: conversational and concise\\n\\nNow give your response.

In order to widen the range of biomolecules that the model can predict, the AlphaFold team significantly expanded the data used for training the newer model to include DNA, RNA, small molecules, and more[11]. This approach allowed the model to be trained on a more diverse set of molecular structures, leading to improved accuracy in predicting the structures of complexes formed by proteins with DNA, RNA, ligands, and ions[12].\n\nThe introduction of AlphaFold 3 brought about a revolution in protein structure modeling and design, enabling a wide range of applications in this field[13]. The model features a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that can predict the joint structure of complexes involving proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions, and modified residues. To address the issue of hallucination in generative models, a cross-distillation method was implemented to augment the training data with predicted structures, resulting in the development of AlphaFold-Multimer (v.2.3)[14].\n\nRecent advancements in machine learning methods and algorithmic approaches have also contributed to the improved accuracy of protein structure prediction models like AlphaFold 3. The latest version of the AlphaFold model, known as \"AlphaFold-latest,\" has expanded on the functionalities of its predecessor, AlphaFold 2, showcasing the ongoing progress in the field of protein structure prediction[15].",
