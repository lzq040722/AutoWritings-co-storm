The survival of many societies, and of the biological support systems of the planet, is at risk. The Agenda also identifies UNFCCC as the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change and reaffirms the determination of Member States to address the threat posed by climate change and environmental degradation. Among the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goal 13 focuses on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\n[2]: Some researchers also presented the evolution of themes over the years, and the co-occurrence maps of key words in the context of climate change and sustainable development practice, and found that there have been many research studies in these areas, but there is still a need for more in-depth study . However, as highlighted in the background, after the 2015 Paris Agreement and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals were proposed, researchers worldwide are called upon to perform comprehensive and systematic analyses, categorizations, and discussions of the results presented by these literature analysis tools.\n[3]: The authors consider the risks of climate change and the role of climate mitigation and adaptation policies within a sustainable development context, aiming to identify possible synergies between development priorities and climate policy objectives. Despite recognition of adaptation as an important target for policy, the background papers and this synthesis paper mainly emphasise mitigation policy.\n[4]: It requires raising ambition, covering entire economies and moving towards climate-resilient development, while outlining a clear path to achieve net-zero emissions. Immediate measures are necessary to avoid catastrophic consequences and secure a sustainable future for generations to come.\n[5]: Numerous studies highlight the role of climate variability on communities and urban development93,94,95,96,97. Most notably, climate change-driven extreme weather events impacts on basic services, infrastructure, housing, human livelihoods and health98. Against this background, the vision of sustainable cities and communities will be lost unless they are encouraged to enhance resilience through an effective climate action framework, incorporating green infrastructure99 and community-based educational tools within SDG11.\n[6]: Breuer, A., Janetschek, H. & Malerba, D. Translating sustainable development goal (SDG) interdependencies into policy advice. Sustainability 11, 2092 (2019). ... O\u2019Neill, B. C. et al. Achievements and needs for the climate change scenario framework.\n[7]: To move fast in the race against climate crisis, targeted actions that bring tangible benefits and limit the trade-offs on multiple fronts, are key for common success against climate change. The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the world\u2019s plan of action to achieving sustainability and resilience for people and planet, are closely linked with climate.\n[8]: Because the effects of climate change cannot be attributed to each specific country that causes greenhouse emissions, all countries are at the same time culprits and victims of the problem, albeit to different degrees. If this is the case, international cooperation should be the obvious pathway to address this collective problem. However, international cooperation has so far obtained modest results, as global temperatures and fossil fuel emissions continue to rise globally despite years of negotiations aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.\n[9]: As we face this global emergency, the need for international cooperation has never been greater. \ud83d\udc49 In this article, we\u2019ll explore why working together is the only viable solution to combating climate change. We\u2019ll uncover how global partnerships, shared technologies, and joint climate policies are already making an impact - and why isolationist approaches fall short in addressing the scale of the crisis.\n[10]: But climate change is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. Emissions anywhere affect people everywhere. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level and it requires international cooperation to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. To address climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris on 12 December 2015.\n[11]: Australia works closely with international partners to address the impacts of climate change and supports full, equal, and diverse participation and leadership in international climate processes. We continue to recognise the unique contributions of Indigenous Peoples, women and girls, persons with disabilities, and youth in climate change action. Australia continues to work with Pacific island Countries in bidding to host COP31 in 2026 to accelerate global climate action and to bring profile to the climate impacts in our region.\n[12]: The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) stands as a critical global framework, fostering international collaboration to address the pressing issue of climate change. Through its agreements and protocols, the UNFCCC provides a platform for nations to collectively work toward reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapting to the changing climate, emphasising the essential role of global cooperation in combating this multifaceted challenge.\n[13]: Nairobi/ Geneva, 26 February \u2013 The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is calling for strengthened global cooperation in addressing climate-induced migration as world leaders convene for the sixth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA). \u201cAs leaders and decision makers gather at UNEA to set the global environmental agenda, let us not forget the plight of those forced to move due to climate and environmental factors,\u201d said IOM Chief of Staff Mohammed Abdiker.\n[14]: Both California and South Australia are global leaders in advancing the clean energy transition and have set ambitious goals to achieve 100 percent clean electricity. Both are members of the Mediterranean Climate Action Partnership (MCAP), which was launched at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, and both are committed to research, innovation, and international cooperation aimed at addressing shared challenges, building competitiveness, and accelerating a just and equitable green transition.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\n\nNow give your response.

                "content": "Climate change and sustainable development are interconnected issues that require a combination of global cooperation and individual action to address effectively. The impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation, are posing significant threats to coastal areas, low-lying countries, and vulnerable populations[1][5]. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) plays a crucial role as the primary forum for negotiating global responses to climate change, emphasizing the urgency of taking action to combat its impacts[1]. Sustainable Development Goal 13 specifically targets the need for urgent action to address climate change and its consequences[1].\n\nResearchers have highlighted the evolution of themes related to climate change and sustainable development over the years, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive analyses and discussions following the 2015 Paris Agreement and the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals[2]. The integration of climate mitigation and adaptation policies within the framework of sustainable development aims to identify synergies between development priorities and climate objectives, with a focus on both mitigation and adaptation efforts[3].\n\nTo achieve sustainable development in the face of climate change, it is essential to raise ambition, transition towards climate-resilient development, and work towards achieving net-zero emissions[4]. This requires immediate action to avoid catastrophic consequences and ensure a sustainable future for future generations[4]. Sustainable cities and communities are also highlighted as critical areas where resilience-building measures and effective climate action frameworks are necessary to address the impacts of climate change on infrastructure, livelihoods, and health[5].\n\nGlobal cooperation is recognized as vital in addressing climate change, as the effects of greenhouse gas emissions transcend national borders, making all countries both contributors to and victims of the problem to varying degrees[8][10]. International partnerships, shared technologies, and joint climate policies have been effective in making an impact in combating climate change, underscoring the importance of collaborative efforts on a global scale[9].\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of global cooperation through platforms like the UNFCCC, individual actions at the local level, and the integration of climate objectives into sustainable development agendas are essential components in the fight against climate change. Only through collective efforts and shared responsibilities can we effectively address the challenges posed by climate change and work towards a more sustainable future for all.",

The survival of many societies, and of the biological support systems of the planet, is at risk. The Agenda also identifies UNFCCC as the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change and reaffirms the determination of Member States to address the threat posed by climate change and environmental degradation. Among the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goal 13 focuses on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\\n[2]: Some researchers also presented the evolution of themes over the years, and the co-occurrence maps of key words in the context of climate change and sustainable development practice, and found that there have been many research studies in these areas, but there is still a need for more in-depth study . However, as highlighted in the background, after the 2015 Paris Agreement and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals were proposed, researchers worldwide are called upon to perform comprehensive and systematic analyses, categorizations, and discussions of the results presented by these literature analysis tools.\\n[3]: The authors consider the risks of climate change and the role of climate mitigation and adaptation policies within a sustainable development context, aiming to identify possible synergies between development priorities and climate policy objectives. Despite recognition of adaptation as an important target for policy, the background papers and this synthesis paper mainly emphasise mitigation policy.\\n[4]: It requires raising ambition, covering entire economies and moving towards climate-resilient development, while outlining a clear path to achieve net-zero emissions. Immediate measures are necessary to avoid catastrophic consequences and secure a sustainable future for generations to come.\\n[5]: Numerous studies highlight the role of climate variability on communities and urban development93,94,95,96,97. Most notably, climate change-driven extreme weather events impacts on basic services, infrastructure, housing, human livelihoods and health98. Against this background, the vision of sustainable cities and communities will be lost unless they are encouraged to enhance resilience through an effective climate action framework, incorporating green infrastructure99 and community-based educational tools within SDG11.\\n[6]: Breuer, A., Janetschek, H. & Malerba, D. Translating sustainable development goal (SDG) interdependencies into policy advice. Sustainability 11, 2092 (2019). ... O\\u2019Neill, B. C. et al. Achievements and needs for the climate change scenario framework.\\n[7]: To move fast in the race against climate crisis, targeted actions that bring tangible benefits and limit the trade-offs on multiple fronts, are key for common success against climate change. The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the world\\u2019s plan of action to achieving sustainability and resilience for people and planet, are closely linked with climate.\\n[8]: Because the effects of climate change cannot be attributed to each specific country that causes greenhouse emissions, all countries are at the same time culprits and victims of the problem, albeit to different degrees. If this is the case, international cooperation should be the obvious pathway to address this collective problem. However, international cooperation has so far obtained modest results, as global temperatures and fossil fuel emissions continue to rise globally despite years of negotiations aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.\\n[9]: As we face this global emergency, the need for international cooperation has never been greater. \\ud83d\\udc49 In this article, we\\u2019ll explore why working together is the only viable solution to combating climate change. We\\u2019ll uncover how global partnerships, shared technologies, and joint climate policies are already making an impact - and why isolationist approaches fall short in addressing the scale of the crisis.\\n[10]: But climate change is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. Emissions anywhere affect people everywhere. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level and it requires international cooperation to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. To address climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris on 12 December 2015.\\n[11]: Australia works closely with international partners to address the impacts of climate change and supports full, equal, and diverse participation and leadership in international climate processes. We continue to recognise the unique contributions of Indigenous Peoples, women and girls, persons with disabilities, and youth in climate change action. Australia continues to work with Pacific island Countries in bidding to host COP31 in 2026 to accelerate global climate action and to bring profile to the climate impacts in our region.\\n[12]: The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) stands as a critical global framework, fostering international collaboration to address the pressing issue of climate change. Through its agreements and protocols, the UNFCCC provides a platform for nations to collectively work toward reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapting to the changing climate, emphasising the essential role of global cooperation in combating this multifaceted challenge.\\n[13]: Nairobi/ Geneva, 26 February \\u2013 The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is calling for strengthened global cooperation in addressing climate-induced migration as world leaders convene for the sixth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA). \\u201cAs leaders and decision makers gather at UNEA to set the global environmental agenda, let us not forget the plight of those forced to move due to climate and environmental factors,\\u201d said IOM Chief of Staff Mohammed Abdiker.\\n[14]: Both California and South Australia are global leaders in advancing the clean energy transition and have set ambitious goals to achieve 100 percent clean electricity. Both are members of the Mediterranean Climate Action Partnership (MCAP), which was launched at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, and both are committed to research, innovation, and international cooperation aimed at addressing shared challenges, building competitiveness, and accelerating a just and equitable green transition.\\n\\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\\n\\nNow give your response.

We analyzed 65 grant reports from 19 of our grassroots partners between 2015 \u2013 2021 and identified 254 outcomes (social and political changes) influencing 285 actors.\n[2]: In the last several years, activists like Greta Thunberg have become media stars and household names; national news outlets have ramped up their coverage of climate campaigns; and politicians have become increasingly outspoken about how environmental issues affect policy decisions. The surge in awareness of environmental issues can largely be attributed to the influence of grassroots movements.\n[3]: In an independent analysis of 65 grant reports from 19 of its grassroots partners between 2015 \u2013 2021, the CLIMA Fund identified 254 outcomes influencing 285 actors. The briefs demonstrate that grassroots movements are critical for advancing holistic and equitable climate action. To learn how grassroots movements are philanthropy\u2019s best bet to confront the climate crisis, read Grassroots Movements and Policy Change: Investing in Grassroots Movements to Build Political Will for Climate Solutions and Grassroots Movements and Systemic Change: Investing in Grassroots Systemic Climate Solutions now.\n[4]: There is considerable cross-national variation in the patterns of adoption and implementation of policies designed to mitigate climate change. The sources of this variation are considered. International relations, economic structures, national cultures and domestic political competition are factors, often in interaction one with another. In situations of multilevel governance, sub-national actors may be significant. Grassroots activism from without the formal political process has sometimes been critical in sharpening the focus of formal political actors, and increasing their willingness to act.\n[5]: A grassroots movement comprises people from a community as the basis for economic or political action. These bottom-up approaches allow people to influence policies through the action they take on a local level. The idea is that people who adopt a practice or action can have an enormous impact on a global scale. Support Independent Climate JournalismHelp us continue providing unbiased, in-depth coverage on climate change.\n[6]: By 2000, there were well over 6000 national and regional environmental movement organizations in the United States alone, and more than 20,000 local organizations  and with increased concern over global climate change, the number of grassroots and professionally-staffed environmental advocacy organizations worldwide has risen sharply.\n[7]: These are all critical questions that will help build the foundations for impactful change. This means that communities need to be involved in forming climate action plans and local initiatives to see success in the coming years. We\u2019ve pulled together a few of the most effective ways to get communities involved in climate action plans targeting different sectors of the economy in a bid to inspire ideas behind your next climate community engagement.\n[8]: By rolling out an online community engagement platform while developing climate action plans, you can access traditionally unheard voices and pinpoint these inequalities and gaps in climate planning. It\u2019s going to take significant reform in individual and collective actions to build climate resilience and lessen the long term impacts of climate change.\n[9]: Introduction Climate change poses a significant threat to communities worldwide, manifesting through extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to local ecosystems. While global policies and international agreements play a vital role in addressing this crisis, the most effective solutions often begin at the local level.\n[10]: Climate change poses one of the most significant challenges of our time, and it requires a collective effort to tackle its devastating impacts. While global initiatives and policies play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, community engagement is equally essential in this battle.\n[11]: In the face of climate change, the need to rapidly transition to an inclusive green economy is urgent. This transition will only be effective and equitable, however, if it is driven by the voices of those most impacted. Local stakeholders have both the historical context and the expertise to know what solutions will work best in their own communities. Inclusive community engagement not only provides communities with a real stake and sense of ownership over local transformation, it also ensures that solutions connect the dots between climate threats and immediate on-the-ground needs.\n[12]: The Draft Policy addressed the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Paris Agreement, community initiatives, renewable energy, and the impact of climate change on emergency management around extreme weather events including bushfires, rising sea levels and impacts on biodiversity. While it cuts through the swathe of inaction at a federal level, community engagement at a local level can also articulate the cause and effect relationship between climate change and issues such as air, water and other natural resources.\n[13]: One of the foundational elements of effective community engagement is awareness and education. Many people still lack a comprehensive understanding of climate change and its implications for their daily lives. Community workshops, town-hall meetings, and educational campaigns can play a pivotal role in raising awareness about the causes and consequences of climate change. Through informed decision-making, individuals can make sustainable choices that collectively lead to a significant positive impact.\n[14]: Public engagement foregrounds inclusion and justice; reaching out to seldom-heard communities, making active attempts to counter exclusion through capacity-building, support, and creating safe, trusted spaces for the public to discuss climate change issues. Public Engagement enables multilevel, multi-sectoral partnerships and collaboration across government policies on climate change, business, civic and climate change organisations, and the public.\n[15]: Community engagement is clearly necessary for effective climate policy, and it\u2019s also doable at all levels of governance. Without meaningfully centering equity in our policies, plans, and programs through the direct involvement of those impacted, we cannot create sustainable solutions to the climate crisis.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\n\nNow give your response.

We analyzed 65 grant reports from 19 of our grassroots partners between 2015 \\u2013 2021 and identified 254 outcomes (social and political changes) influencing 285 actors.\\n[2]: In the last several years, activists like Greta Thunberg have become media stars and household names; national news outlets have ramped up their coverage of climate campaigns; and politicians have become increasingly outspoken about how environmental issues affect policy decisions. The surge in awareness of environmental issues can largely be attributed to the influence of grassroots movements.\\n[3]: In an independent analysis of 65 grant reports from 19 of its grassroots partners between 2015 \\u2013 2021, the CLIMA Fund identified 254 outcomes influencing 285 actors. The briefs demonstrate that grassroots movements are critical for advancing holistic and equitable climate action. To learn how grassroots movements are philanthropy\\u2019s best bet to confront the climate crisis, read Grassroots Movements and Policy Change: Investing in Grassroots Movements to Build Political Will for Climate Solutions and Grassroots Movements and Systemic Change: Investing in Grassroots Systemic Climate Solutions now.\\n[4]: There is considerable cross-national variation in the patterns of adoption and implementation of policies designed to mitigate climate change. The sources of this variation are considered. International relations, economic structures, national cultures and domestic political competition are factors, often in interaction one with another. In situations of multilevel governance, sub-national actors may be significant. Grassroots activism from without the formal political process has sometimes been critical in sharpening the focus of formal political actors, and increasing their willingness to act.\\n[5]: A grassroots movement comprises people from a community as the basis for economic or political action. These bottom-up approaches allow people to influence policies through the action they take on a local level. The idea is that people who adopt a practice or action can have an enormous impact on a global scale. Support Independent Climate JournalismHelp us continue providing unbiased, in-depth coverage on climate change.\\n[6]: By 2000, there were well over 6000 national and regional environmental movement organizations in the United States alone, and more than 20,000 local organizations  and with increased concern over global climate change, the number of grassroots and professionally-staffed environmental advocacy organizations worldwide has risen sharply.\\n[7]: These are all critical questions that will help build the foundations for impactful change. This means that communities need to be involved in forming climate action plans and local initiatives to see success in the coming years. We\\u2019ve pulled together a few of the most effective ways to get communities involved in climate action plans targeting different sectors of the economy in a bid to inspire ideas behind your next climate community engagement.\\n[8]: By rolling out an online community engagement platform while developing climate action plans, you can access traditionally unheard voices and pinpoint these inequalities and gaps in climate planning. It\\u2019s going to take significant reform in individual and collective actions to build climate resilience and lessen the long term impacts of climate change.\\n[9]: Introduction Climate change poses a significant threat to communities worldwide, manifesting through extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to local ecosystems. While global policies and international agreements play a vital role in addressing this crisis, the most effective solutions often begin at the local level.\\n[10]: Climate change poses one of the most significant challenges of our time, and it requires a collective effort to tackle its devastating impacts.

Three years of researching dozens of major cities around the globe as part of Oliver Wyman Forum\u2019s Urban Mobility Readiness Index has helped us identify the policies pivotal in determining whether cities emerge from COVID as leaders in sustainability and the battle against climate change or whether COVID will mark the beginning of their decline.\n[2]: A SUMP should foresee cooperation and synergies between all levels of government, local, regional, national and across different policy areas. It should be prepared in partnership with local residents and stakeholders. It ensures a variety of sustainable transport options for the safe, healthy and fluid passage of people and goods, with all due consideration for fellow residents and the urban environment. The EU city database on SUMPs collects information on Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) and other urban mobility plans in EU Member States.\n[3]: This module addresses how gender should be addressed in transport policy and planning. Unsuccessful, inefficient and unsustainable transport can result\u2026 ... Changing mobility patterns can be rough. But there is ways to get even the car lovers on board. This training\u2026 ... The publication presents financing instruments for sustainable urban transport, and shows how to combine them.\n[4]: Contents1 Eco-Friendly Transportation in Urban Planning: An Essential Step Towards Sustainable Cities1.1 Introduction2 Historical Background3 Key Concepts and Definitions4 Main Discussion Points4.1 Benefits of Eco-Friendly Transportation in Urban Planning4.2 Strategies and Initiatives for Implementing Eco-Friendly Transportation in Urban Planning4.3 Community Engagement and Participation in Eco-Friendly Transportation Initiatives5 Case Studies or Examples6 Current Trends or Developments7\n[5]: In this study, the MCDM process includes evaluating the alternatives of urban transportation strategy under the fuzzy environment. This paper presents the evolution of a new approach for city and transportation planners that is flexible and practicable and based on sustainability. This research provides a useful guideline for the decision-making process for strategic transportation plans in many cities. Thus, this research makes a contribution to academic knowledge and public policy.\n[6]: A rapid and large-scale reduction in car use, within a well-designed policy mix, is necessary to achieve short-term emission targets and reduce energy demand. Here, the authors introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model and demonstrate, using London as a case study, that current policies will not meet climate targets.\n[7]: Around the world, especially in the Global South, very few examples can be found where the responsibilities for urban transport governance are coordinated effectively. In many cities, a combination of weak administrative arrangements, limited planning capacity, and a lack of coordination between land use and transport policy-making prevails, which together inhibits the development of more innovative, integrated, and sustainable policies (Pojani and Stead Citation2017).\n[8]: Land use changes, reducing cars, more public and active transportation, and greening are needed. ... Health impact assessment studies provide evidence on how to make cities healthier.\n[9]: by Siqi Zheng, STL Champion Professor of Urban and Real Estate Sustainability, MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning ... U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: \"Smart growth and transportation\" C40 Knowledge Hub: \"How to make public transport an attractive option in your city\" International Energy Agency: \"GHG intensity of passenger transport modes\" International Transport Forum: \"ITF Transport Outlook 2021\" (Report) National Academies: \"An Update on Public Transportation's Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Emissions\" (Report)\n[10]: These not only cause significant emissions, but also contribute to air pollution and related health risks in cities. Impacts are often the worst in low-income and disadvantaged communities, which are disproportionately located near transport infrastructure. By contrast, public electric buses are a much cleaner option, emitting less than half as much carbon as gas-powered private cars per passenger-kilometer traveled.\n[11]: Based on Lyapunov optimization, this multi-slot global optimization problem is converted into a series of low-complexity problems that only require knowledge of the instantaneous system state. The equivalence of this transformation is proved theoretically. Then Harmony search algorithm is used to solve these low-complexity models. A case study based on the transportation network composed of five central cities in China is conducted.\n[12]: Background: Transportation has become the second-largest source of global carbon emissions. Promoting low-carbon development by means of public transport and green travel and analyzing the mechanism and path of the carbon emissions reduction effect of public transport have become key to reducing carbon emissions in the transportation field and achieving \u201ccarbon peak and carbon neutrality\u201d. Methods: The data from 30 provinces (2010\u20132019) were extracted from China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs), China Energy Statistical Yearbook, China Statistical Yearbook, and China Automobile Statistical Yearbook.\n[13]: HTML Format - At a Glance The largest source of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2, the most common greenhouse gas) in the United States is the transportation sector. Emissions from transportation surpassed emissions from the electric power sector five years ago and now constitute two-fifths of domestic emissions from burning fossil fuels.\n[14]: Active travel (walking or cycling for transport) is considered the most sustainable form of personal transport. Yet its net effects on mobility-related CO2 emissions are complex and under-researched. Here we collected travel activity data in seven European cities and derived life cycle CO2 emissions across modes and purposes.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\n\nNow give your response.

Three years of researching dozens of major cities around the globe as part of Oliver Wyman Forum\\u2019s Urban Mobility Readiness Index has helped us identify the policies pivotal in determining whether cities emerge from COVID as leaders in sustainability and the battle against climate change or whether COVID will mark the beginning of their decline.\\n[2]: A SUMP should foresee cooperation and synergies between all levels of government, local, regional, national and across different policy areas. It should be prepared in partnership with local residents and stakeholders. It ensures a variety of sustainable transport options for the safe, healthy and fluid passage of people and goods, with all due consideration for fellow residents and the urban environment. The EU city database on SUMPs collects information on Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) and other urban mobility plans in EU Member States.\\n[3]: This module addresses how gender should be addressed in transport policy and planning.

The publication presents financing instruments for sustainable urban transport, and shows how to combine them.\\n[4]: Contents1 Eco-Friendly Transportation in Urban Planning: An Essential Step Towards Sustainable Cities1.1 Introduction2 Historical Background3 Key Concepts and Definitions4 Main Discussion Points4.1 Benefits of Eco-Friendly Transportation in Urban Planning4.2 Strategies and Initiatives for Implementing Eco-Friendly Transportation in Urban Planning4.3 Community Engagement and Participation in Eco-Friendly Transportation Initiatives5 Case Studies or Examples6 Current Trends or Developments7\\n[5]: In this study, the MCDM process includes evaluating the alternatives of urban transportation strategy under the fuzzy environment. This paper presents the evolution of a new approach for city and transportation planners that is flexible and practicable and based on sustainability. This research provides a useful guideline for the decision-making process for strategic transportation plans in many cities. Thus, this research makes a contribution to academic knowledge and public policy.\\n[6]: A rapid and large-scale reduction in car use, within a well-designed policy mix, is necessary to achieve short-term emission targets and reduce energy demand. Here, the authors introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model and demonstrate, using London as a case study, that current policies will not meet climate targets.\\n[7]: Around the world, especially in the Global South, very few examples can be found where the responsibilities for urban transport governance are coordinated effectively. In many cities, a combination of weak administrative arrangements, limited planning capacity, and a lack of coordination between land use and transport policy-making prevails, which together inhibits the development of more innovative, integrated, and sustainable policies (Pojani and Stead Citation2017).\\n[8]: Land use changes, reducing cars, more public and active transportation, and greening are needed. ... Health impact assessment studies provide evidence on how to make cities healthier.\\n[9]: by Siqi Zheng, STL Champion Professor of Urban and Real Estate Sustainability, MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning ...

Impacts are often the worst in low-income and disadvantaged communities, which are disproportionately located near transport infrastructure. By contrast, public electric buses are a much cleaner option, emitting less than half as much carbon as gas-powered private cars per passenger-kilometer traveled.\\n[11]: Based on Lyapunov optimization, this multi-slot global optimization problem is converted into a series of low-complexity problems that only require knowledge of the instantaneous system state. The equivalence of this transformation is proved theoretically. Then Harmony search algorithm is used to solve these low-complexity models. A case study based on the transportation network composed of five central cities in China is conducted.\\n[12]: Background: Transportation has become the second-largest source of global carbon emissions. Promoting low-carbon development by means of public transport and green travel and analyzing the mechanism and path of the carbon emissions reduction effect of public transport have become key to reducing carbon emissions in the transportation field and achieving \\u201ccarbon peak and carbon neutrality\\u201d. Methods: The data from 30 provinces (2010\\u20132019) were extracted from China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs), China Energy Statistical Yearbook, China Statistical Yearbook, and China Automobile Statistical Yearbook.\\n[13]: HTML Format - At a Glance The largest source of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2, the most common greenhouse gas) in the United States is the transportation sector. Emissions from transportation surpassed emissions from the electric power sector five years ago and now constitute two-fifths of domestic emissions from burning fossil fuels.\\n[14]: Active travel (walking or cycling for transport) is considered the most sustainable form of personal transport. Yet its net effects on mobility-related CO2 emissions are complex and under-researched. Here we collected travel activity data in seven European cities and derived life cycle CO2 emissions across modes and purposes.\\n\\nStyle of your response should be: conversational\\n\\nNow give your response.

We\u2019ll uncover how global partnerships, shared technologies, and joint climate policies are already making an impact - and why isolationist approaches fall short in addressing the scale of the crisis.\n[3]: The poorest countries face the greatest risks from climate change and require international support to finance adaptation. All countries, rich and poor, must adapt to climate change. A recent report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out the dramatic consequences of failing to curb the rise in global temperature and adapting to a hotter planet. Adaptation should address risks from climate change and extreme weather, for example by safeguarding agriculture, managing the impact of rising seas, and making infrastructure more resilient.\n[4]: International efforts, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But experts say countries aren\u2019t doing enough to limit dangerous global warming. A consequence of climate change is the increased likelihood of record-breaking floods.\n[5]: The AR5 found that two characteristics of climate change make international cooperation essential: that it is a global commons problem that needs to be addressed in a coordinated fashion at the global scale; and that given the global diversity with respect to opportunities for and cost of mitigation, there are economic efficiencies associated with cooperative solutions (Section 13.2.1.1).\n[6]: Climate change is a \u201ccrisis multiplier\u201d that has profound implications for international peace and stability, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told the Security Council today, amid calls for deep partnerships within and beyond the United Nations system to blunt its acute effects on food security, natural resources and migration patterns fuelling tensions across countries and regions.\n[7]: International cooperation, for example through the Paris Agreement, is crucial in guiding and achieving global and national mitigation goals. Mitigation efforts face challenges such as the world's deep-rooted dependency on fossil fuels, the increased demand for new mineral resources and the difficulties in revamping our food systems. These challenges also offer opportunities to improve resilience and contribute to sustainable development. Climate change mitigation refers to any action taken by governments, businesses or people to reduce or prevent greenhouse gases, or to enhance carbon sinks that remove them from the atmosphere.\n[8]: International agreements on ways to tackle climate change are in a depressing deadlock. This column argues that part of the problem is aiming too high. It suggests that slow and gradual progress towards controlling climate change is the only way forward. But this is at least better than waiting for an ideal solution that may never come.\n[9]: Because this is the case, international cooperation is therefore the pathway to address this global crisis. More so, the argument has been that developed nations have benefited disproportionately from greenhouse emissions and should now shoulder the majority of the costs associated with reducing emissions and tackling the crisis. Given all of the above bases, there have been some international treaties, such as the Montreal Protocol, which successfully saved the ozone layer and phased out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and now the Paris Agreement.\n[10]: One of the most significant advantages of international cooperation in addressing the climate crisis is the ability to share both technology and knowledge across borders.

We address the following question: What accountability measures serve to align the incentives of the donor with those of the recipient in climate change financing?\n[3]: The legislation will amend the Climate Change Accountability Act to require detailed annual reporting to track progress on reducing carbon pollution and to forecast expected emissions. It will also mandate the creation of an interim emissions target, by the end of next year, as a midway checkpoint before the legislated 2030 target. An independent advisory committee will review progress and recommend changes to ensure B.C.\u2019s targets are actually being met.\n[4]: Abstract. Global environmental governance (GEG) is characterized by fragmentation, duplication, dispersed authority, and weak regulations. The gap between the need for action and existing responses has led to demands for accountability. This has created a paradox: accountability mechanisms to improve GEG have proliferated while the environment deteriorates.\n[5]: Firms are increasingly announcing targets to reduce their carbon emissions, but it is unclear whether firms are held accountable for these targets. Here we examine emissions targets that ended in 2020 to investigate the final target outcomes, the transparency of target outcomes and potential consequences for missed emissions targets.\n[6]: Without effective accountability mechanisms \u2013 as well as actors who actually use the available mechanisms \u2013 there is a risk of stopping short. We risk creating a reward culture centred on ambitious promises, rather than one characterized by bold and ambitious actions. Why will gears on climate accountability shift in 2022? In many ways, it is an entirely expected consequence of the Paris Agreement architecture. COP26 marked the finalization of the Paris Rulebook to ensure that the agreement can track progress to meet its goals and the start of preparations for the 2023 global stocktake\ufeff, which will actually monitor progress.\n[7]: The agreement not only formalizes the process of developing national plans, but also it provides a binding requirement to assess and review progress on these plans. This mechanism will require countries to continuously upgrade their commitments and ensure that there will be no backtracking.\n[8]: We uphold a commitment to subnational climate accountability. Accountability is an important strategic pillar of the Under2 Coalition. Since 2017, we've upheld a commitment to transparent and regular disclosure, alignment with emerging global credibility standards and building capacity to monitor, evaluate and measure net zero progress.\n[9]: Kluvers, R., & Tippett, J. (2010). Mechanisms of accountability in local government: An exploratory study. International Journal of Business and Management, 5(7), 46\u201353.\n[10]: Climate change framework laws are needed for the successful implementation of the Paris Agreement. This policy insight examines the elements that can be \u2018built in\u2019 to framework laws to specify accountability for the implementation of the core obligations contained within, based on a review of 43 such laws from the Climate Change Laws of the World database.\n[11]: To ensure that the world is on track to meet its climate goals, international cooperation must be strengthened, with a focus on more ambitious, legally binding commitments and enhanced global governance. Here are several key areas for improvement: In today\u2019s world, companies play a crucial role in addressing climate change and fostering sustainability.\n[12]: Another aspect of the problem with climate change cooperation is that the threat, although certain, is not as immediate, condensed or recognizable as threats that have historically aligned nations behind a common purpose. An invasion or nuclear attack is clearly identifiable and their potential effects produced in a short period of time. Effects of climate change build up over time and in many circumstances cannot be immediately attributable to greenhouse emissions. The global reaction to COVID-19, which significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions, was less a result of global cooperation than countries reacting individually and not necessarily in concert to deal with a common public threat.\n[13]: Tackling Climate Change Goal 13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It is intrinsically linked to all 16 of the other Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

To ensure accountability and progress towards climate goals, mechanisms like detailed annual reporting, setting interim emissions targets, and creating independent advisory committees are essential [3][7]. These measures not only track progress but also provide recommendations for necessary changes to meet set targets [3]. \n\nGlobal environmental governance faces challenges due to fragmentation and weak regulations, leading to demands for accountability [4]. This highlights the need for effective mechanisms to ensure that countries continuously upgrade their commitments and prevent backtracking [7]. Subnational climate accountability is also crucial, as emphasized by the Under2 Coalition, which focuses on transparent disclosure and monitoring of progress towards net zero [8].\n\nThe Paris Agreement serves as a framework for international cooperation and emphasizes the need for more ambitious commitments and enhanced global governance to tackle climate change effectively [11]. Additionally, the urgency to combat climate change is highlighted by Goal 13 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which calls for urgent action to limit global temperature rise [13].\n\nWhile governments have the power to implement policies and regulations, individual action is equally important in addressing climate change [16].

We address the following question: What accountability measures serve to align the incentives of the donor with those of the recipient in climate change financing?\\n[3]: The legislation will amend the Climate Change Accountability Act to require detailed annual reporting to track progress on reducing carbon pollution and to forecast expected emissions. It will also mandate the creation of an interim emissions target, by the end of next year, as a midway checkpoint before the legislated 2030 target. An independent advisory committee will review progress and recommend changes to ensure B.C.\\u2019s targets are actually being met.\\n[4]: Abstract. Global environmental governance (GEG) is characterized by fragmentation, duplication, dispersed authority, and weak regulations. The gap between the need for action and existing responses has led to demands for accountability. This has created a paradox: accountability mechanisms to improve GEG have proliferated while the environment deteriorates.\\n[5]: Firms are increasingly announcing targets to reduce their carbon emissions, but it is unclear whether firms are held accountable for these targets. Here we examine emissions targets that ended in 2020 to investigate the final target outcomes, the transparency of target outcomes and potential consequences for missed emissions targets.\\n[6]: Without effective accountability mechanisms \\u2013 as well as actors who actually use the available mechanisms \\u2013 there is a risk of stopping short. We risk creating a reward culture centred on ambitious promises, rather than one characterized by bold and ambitious actions. Why will gears on climate accountability shift in 2022? In many ways, it is an entirely expected consequence of the Paris Agreement architecture. COP26 marked the finalization of the Paris Rulebook to ensure that the agreement can track progress to meet its goals and the start of preparations for the 2023 global stocktake\\ufeff, which will actually monitor progress.\\n[7]: The agreement not only formalizes the process of developing national plans, but also it provides a binding requirement to assess and review progress on these plans. This mechanism will require countries to continuously upgrade their commitments and ensure that there will be no backtracking.\\n[8]: We uphold a commitment to subnational climate accountability. Accountability is an important strategic pillar of the Under2 Coalition. Since 2017, we've upheld a commitment to transparent and regular disclosure, alignment with emerging global credibility standards and building capacity to monitor, evaluate and measure net zero progress.\\n[9]: Kluvers, R., & Tippett, J. (2010). Mechanisms of accountability in local government: An exploratory study. International Journal of Business and Management, 5(7), 46\\u201353.\\n[10]: Climate change framework laws are needed for the successful implementation of the Paris Agreement. This policy insight examines the elements that can be \\u2018built in\\u2019 to framework laws to specify accountability for the implementation of the core obligations contained within, based on a review of 43 such laws from the Climate Change Laws of the World database.\\n[11]: To ensure that the world is on track to meet its climate goals, international cooperation must be strengthened, with a focus on more ambitious, legally binding commitments and enhanced global governance. Here are several key areas for improvement: In today\\u2019s world, companies play a crucial role in addressing climate change and fostering sustainability.\\n[12]: Another aspect of the problem with climate change cooperation is that the threat, although certain, is not as immediate, condensed or recognizable as threats that have historically aligned nations behind a common purpose. An invasion or nuclear attack is clearly identifiable and their potential effects produced in a short period of time. Effects of climate change build up over time and in many circumstances cannot be immediately attributable to greenhouse emissions. The global reaction to COVID-19, which significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions, was less a result of global cooperation than countries reacting individually and not necessarily in concert to deal with a common public threat.\\n[13]: Tackling Climate Change Goal 13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It is intrinsically linked to all 16 of the other Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To address climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.\\n[14]: Councils in England are taking innovative steps to tackle climate change, including declaring climate emergencies, developing action plans and rolling out demonstrator projects.

The impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation, are posing significant threats to coastal areas, low-lying countries, and vulnerable populations[1][5]. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) plays a crucial role as the primary forum for negotiating global responses to climate change, emphasizing the urgency of taking action to combat its impacts[1]. Sustainable Development Goal 13 specifically targets the need for urgent action to address climate change and its consequences[1].\n\nResearchers have highlighted the evolution of themes related to climate change and sustainable development over the years, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive analyses and discussions following the 2015 Paris Agreement and the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals[2]. The integration of climate mitigation and adaptation policies within the framework of sustainable development aims to identify synergies between development priorities and climate objectives, with a focus on both mitigation and adaptation efforts[3].\n\nTo achieve sustainable development in the face of climate change, it is essential to raise ambition, transition towards climate-resilient development, and work towards achieving net-zero emissions[4]. This requires immediate action to avoid catastrophic consequences and ensure a sustainable future for future generations[4].

The impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation, are posing significant threats to coastal areas, low-lying countries, and vulnerable populations[1][5]. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) plays a crucial role as the primary forum for negotiating global responses to climate change, emphasizing the urgency of taking action to combat its impacts[1]. Sustainable Development Goal 13 specifically targets the need for urgent action to address climate change and its consequences[1].\\n\\nResearchers have highlighted the evolution of themes related to climate change and sustainable development over the years, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive analyses and discussions following the 2015 Paris Agreement and the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals[2]. The integration of climate mitigation and adaptation policies within the framework of sustainable development aims to identify synergies between development priorities and climate objectives, with a focus on both mitigation and adaptation efforts[3].\\n\\nTo achieve sustainable development in the face of climate change, it is essential to raise ambition, transition towards climate-resilient development, and work towards achieving net-zero emissions[4]. This requires immediate action to avoid catastrophic consequences and ensure a sustainable future for future generations[4]. Sustainable cities and communities are also highlighted as critical areas where resilience-building measures and effective climate action frameworks are necessary to address the impacts of climate change on infrastructure, livelihoods, and health[5].\\n\\nGlobal cooperation is recognized as vital in addressing climate change, as the effects of greenhouse gas emissions transcend national borders, making all countries both contributors to and victims of the problem to varying degrees[8][10]. International partnerships, shared technologies, and joint climate policies have been effective in making an impact in combating climate change, underscoring the importance of collaborative efforts on a global scale[9].\\n\\nIn conclusion, the combination of global cooperation through platforms like the UNFCCC, individual actions at the local level, and the integration of climate objectives into sustainable development agendas are essential components in the fight against climate change. Only through collective efforts and shared responsibilities can we effectively address the challenges posed by climate change and work towards a more sustainable future for all.\\n\\nNumber of speakers needed: 3\\n\\nExperts:\"}]}"

We\u2019ll uncover how global partnerships, shared technologies, and joint climate policies are already making an impact - and why isolationist approaches fall short in addressing the scale of the crisis. (Question: Background information about Climate Change and Sustainable Development: A Combination of Global Cooperation and Individual Action. Query: Global cooperation in addressing climate change)\n[8]: But climate change is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. Emissions anywhere affect people everywhere. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level and it requires international cooperation to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy. To address climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris on 12 December 2015.

(Question: What are some key examples of successful international cooperation in addressing climate change, and how can these be replicated on a larger scale?. Query: How can successful international cooperation in addressing climate change be replicated on a larger scale?)\n[29]: The poorest countries face the greatest risks from climate change and require international support to finance adaptation. All countries, rich and poor, must adapt to climate change. A recent report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out the dramatic consequences of failing to curb the rise in global temperature and adapting to a hotter planet. Adaptation should address risks from climate change and extreme weather, for example by safeguarding agriculture, managing the impact of rising seas, and making infrastructure more resilient. (Question: What are some key examples of successful international cooperation in addressing climate change, and how can these be replicated on a larger scale?. Query: How can successful international cooperation in addressing climate change be replicated on a larger scale?)\n[30]: International efforts, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But experts say countries aren\u2019t doing enough to limit dangerous global warming. A consequence of climate change is the increased likelihood of record-breaking floods. (Question: What are some key examples of successful international cooperation in addressing climate change, and how can these be replicated on a larger scale?. Query: How can successful international cooperation in addressing climate change be replicated on a larger scale?)\n[31]: International cooperation, for example through the Paris Agreement, is crucial in guiding and achieving global and national mitigation goals. Mitigation efforts face challenges such as the world's deep-rooted dependency on fossil fuels, the increased demand for new mineral resources and the difficulties in revamping our food systems. These challenges also offer opportunities to improve resilience and contribute to sustainable development. Climate change mitigation refers to any action taken by governments, businesses or people to reduce or prevent greenhouse gases, or to enhance carbon sinks that remove them from the atmosphere. (Question: What are some key examples of successful international cooperation in addressing climate change, and how can these be replicated on a larger scale?. Query: How can successful international cooperation in addressing climate change be replicated on a larger scale?)\n[32]: Because this is the case, international cooperation is therefore the pathway to address this global crisis. More so, the argument has been that developed nations have benefited disproportionately from greenhouse emissions and should now shoulder the majority of the costs associated with reducing emissions and tackling the crisis. Given all of the above bases, there have been some international treaties, such as the Montreal Protocol, which successfully saved the ozone layer and phased out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and now the Paris Agreement. (Question: What are some key examples of successful international cooperation in addressing climate change, and how can these be replicated on a larger scale?. Query: How can successful international cooperation in addressing climate change be replicated on a larger scale?)\n[33]: One of the most significant advantages of international cooperation in addressing the climate crisis is the ability to share both technology and knowledge across borders. No single country has all the solutions to the complex problems posed by climate change. Collaboration enables nations to pool resources, exchange innovations, and learn from each other\u2019s successes and failures, accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future. (Question: What are some key examples of successful international cooperation in addressing climate change, and how can these be replicated on a larger scale?. Query: Examples of successful international cooperation in addressing climate change)\n[34]: Thirty-five years ago, in Montreal, Canada, world leaders came together to make a landmark agreement to protect the ozone layer.

National governments play a crucial role in driving global cooperation on climate change and can put in place mechanisms to track and enforce commitments.\n\nOne proposed mechanism is amending legislation to require detailed annual reporting on progress in reducing carbon pollution and forecasting expected emissions[36]. This would involve setting interim emissions targets and establishing independent advisory committees to review progress and recommend changes to ensure targets are met. Additionally, global environmental governance has seen the proliferation of accountability mechanisms to address the gap between the need for action and existing responses[37].\n\nAnother important aspect is holding firms accountable for their carbon emissions reduction targets. While many firms announce targets, it is essential to ensure transparency and consequences for missed targets to effectively reduce emissions[38]. Furthermore, international agreements such as the Paris Agreement formalize the process of developing national plans and require continuous upgrading of commitments to prevent backtracking[39].\n\nSubnational climate accountability is also a key component, as seen in the commitment of the Under2 Coalition to transparent disclosure, alignment with global standards, and capacity building for monitoring progress towards net-zero emissions[40]. Additionally, the implementation of climate change framework laws can specify accountability for core obligations within the Paris Agreement, ensuring successful implementation[41].\n\nOverall, these mechanisms for ensuring accountability and progress towards climate goals are essential for driving global cooperation on climate change and achieving sustainable development goals. By implementing transparent reporting, setting ambitious targets, and holding stakeholders accountable, national governments can lead the way in addressing the urgent challenges of climate change.",

For instance, by involving communities in the development of climate action plans and local initiatives, policymakers can tap into the knowledge and expertise of those most affected by climate change[14]. This not only ensures that solutions are tailored to the specific needs of each community but also fosters a sense of ownership and commitment to implementing these plans.\n\nIn addition, utilizing online community engagement platforms can help bridge the gap between policymakers and marginalized voices that are often left out of traditional decision-making processes[15]. By creating opportunities for these voices to be heard, policymakers can address inequalities and gaps in climate planning while building a more inclusive and resilient approach to climate change mitigation.\n\nFurthermore, community engagement is essential for driving the transition to a green economy that is both effective and equitable. Local stakeholders, with their unique understanding of their communities, can provide valuable insights into which solutions will work best on the ground[18]. By involving these stakeholders in decision-making processes, policymakers can ensure that climate policies are not only effective but also address immediate on-the-ground needs.\n\nOverall, community engagement plays a crucial role in shaping climate change policy at the local, national, and global levels. By raising awareness, fostering inclusion, and centering equity in decision-making processes, communities can drive meaningful change and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future[20][21].",

Private cars not only contribute significantly to carbon emissions but also to air pollution and related health risks, especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities located near transport infrastructure.

National governments play a crucial role in driving global cooperation on climate change and can put in place mechanisms to track and enforce commitments.\\n\\nOne proposed mechanism is amending legislation to require detailed annual reporting on progress in reducing carbon pollution and forecasting expected emissions[36]. This would involve setting interim emissions targets and establishing independent advisory committees to review progress and recommend changes to ensure targets are met. Additionally, global environmental governance has seen the proliferation of accountability mechanisms to address the gap between the need for action and existing responses[37].\\n\\nAnother important aspect is holding firms accountable for their carbon emissions reduction targets. While many firms announce targets, it is essential to ensure transparency and consequences for missed targets to effectively reduce emissions[38]. Furthermore, international agreements such as the Paris Agreement formalize the process of developing national plans and require continuous upgrading of commitments to prevent backtracking[39].\\n\\nSubnational climate accountability is also a key component, as seen in the commitment of the Under2 Coalition to transparent disclosure, alignment with global standards, and capacity building for monitoring progress towards net-zero emissions[40]. Additionally, the implementation of climate change framework laws can specify accountability for core obligations within the Paris Agreement, ensuring successful implementation[41].\\n\\nNow give engaging question only.\\nQuestion: How can national governments play a crucial role in driving global cooperation on climate change and ensure accountability towards achieving climate goals?\\n\\nNow give engaging answer only with all inline citations from original text.\\nAnswer:\"}]}"

The style of writing should be formal.\n\n---\n\nTopic you are discussing about: Climate Change and Sustainable Development: A Combination of Global Cooperation and Individual Action\n\nYou want to provide insight on: Highlight the potential of blockchain technology in promoting transparency and accountability in sustainable development initiatives.\n\nGathered information:\n[1]: Blockchain technology has been proposed to achieve sustainable development through various solutions, such as carbon credit trading, energy systems and supply chain management. While existing literature has not covered this topic in a structured fashion, this paper provides insights to policymakers on how blockchain can deliver sustainable development.\n[2]: Blockchain will not only improve the economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing, transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust development, and fraud prevention.\n[3]: Blockchain technology has the potential to address several UN Sustainable Development Goals, including promoting affordable and clean energy, responsible consumption, climate action, and natural resource management.\n[4]: There are a number of opportunities for blockchain technology to re-cast conventional approaches to sustainable development \u2013 and accelerate progress if deployed responsibly. There are 3 areas where blockchain could be an SDG game changer: building resilient and transparent supply chains; creating stronger and more accountable public institutions; spurring responsible sourcing and consumption.\n[5]: In the current global context of environmental degradation and resource constraints, the pursuit of sustainable development has become an imperative. One avenue that holds promise for achieving this objective is the application of digital technologies, which have the potential to decouple economic growth from its carbon footprint.\n[6]: In an increasingly digitalized economy and society, the security and accountability of data transactions are critical elements for creating trust and enabling breakthrough innovations in the digital world. In this regard, blockchain technology could be a game-changer, with the potential to revolutionize processes from finance to pharmaceutical industries, from government public services to humanitarian work and development aid.\n[7]: If you have been following the financial news, you may have seen that the value of one bitcoin skyrocketed from around $11,000 in October 2020 to over $62,000 in April 2021, before plummeting to under $32,000 two months later. If you feel lost trying to understand these price movements, you are not alone.\n[8]: In recent years, the term \u201cblockchain\u201d has been sprinkled widely and the hype around it attracts billions in investments. The promises that this technology can be a solution to many of society's present problems have drawn attention from all sectors, including development aid. The historical recognition of potential and actual corruption resulting from development aid sparked a rise in demands for more transparency and accountability in this sector.\n[9]: Blockchain technology is a novel computing model and ecosystem for trusted digital services. The technology promotes trust and decentralization, which has inspired new ways to develop smart digital business, engage communities, and automate societies. This makes it a typical multidisciplinary technology enabler for sustainable development with unique properties including trust, automation, decentralization, immutability, and resilience.\n[10]: The blockchain-based educational infrastructure will promote transparency and sustainability, reduces plagiarism concern and paves the way for remote/virtual learning. ... Increasing energy and gas prices have rattled consumers at all levels. Blockchain has immense potential for renewable energy production to promote efficiency and lower cost. NREL has developed software-enabling users to control their power generation and channel it back to the grid.\n[11]: This review provides valuable suggestions to academicians and practitioners regarding effective financial resource usage to progress toward achieving sustainability goals. ... The potential of FinTech to revolutionize financial services through digital tools, rendering accessible, efficient, and transparent solutions, is widely recognized (Oertli, 2020). This technology can facilitate innovative funding structures, blockchain applications, and novel financial instruments for green finance (Kalaiarasi and Kirubahari, 2023).\n[12]: Blockchain contributes to fair, sustainable, and traceable food supply chains. ... Blockchain is used as a tool to drive technological innovation for sustainability.\n[13]: Perishable foods, vaccines, and cold supply chains require this disruptive technology to control the wastage of food and temperature-controlled pharmaceutical products (\u00d3skarsd\u00f3ttir and Oddsson, 2019). The researchers have developed different models and frameworks in the perspective of economic sustainability through transparency, traceability, visibility, and accountability in supply by using blockchain.\n[14]: The features of immutability and transparency make blockchain technology essential for SMEs\u2019 sustainability. The industry-wide adoption of blockchain occurs either via the ICO route or as an immutable ledger. Similar to any new technology, blockchain faces adoption barriers owing to entrenched interests and other technical factors like scalability, energy consumption, and trust . Investment in server infrastructure and the addition of specialized resources for development and governance keeps companies from adopting blockchain after the proof-of-concept stage . However, it must be noted that the adoption is expected to increase subsequent to the introduction of blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) offerings by the large cloud providers.\n[15]: Policymakers can drive the industry to ensure blockchain delivers sustainable development instead of unintended consequences. ... Paper provides a systematic literature review of 6545 papers on blockchain and sustainability to guide policymakers in this space. Blockchain technology has been proposed to achieve sustainable development through various solutions, such as carbon credit trading, energy systems and supply chain management.\n[16]: This paper presents an in-depth analysis of blockchain technology as a transformative tool for sustainable development across various sectors, including agriculture, healthcare, and finance. At the heart of our investigation is the exploration of blockchain\u2019s decentralized architecture, its role in enhancing transparency, and the security of data management and transactions.\n[17]: Blockchain technology, closely associated with the digital economy, has also been studied in relation to sustainable development. Chandan et al.14 explored the use of blockchain in achieving sustainability goals in the food supply chain, emphasizing its potential to enhance transparency and traceability.\n[18]: applications in the food, fashion, pharmaceutical, automotive, and agriculture industries, underscore the technology's \u00b7 ability to combat fraud, enhance trust, and streamline operations. Industry-wide collaboration and the establishment \u00b7 of common standards are essential to overcoming these challenges and achieving the full potential of blockchain. With \u00b7 ongoing research, development, and strategic investments, blockchain is poised to play a pivotal role in creating more \u00b7 transparent, efficient, and sustainable supply chains for the future.\n\nStyle of your response should be: conversational and concise\n\nNow give your response.

As part of our learning and evaluation process, we employed an Outcome Harvesting methodology to learn how our grassroots movement partners are advancing systemic and policy change to address the climate crisis.\n[2]: It\u2019s another example of how sustainable agriculture tends to improve the overall well-being of communities. Among other things the Public Foundation addresses \u201cfood security, land degradation, water scarcity, and adaptation to climate change.\u201d\n[3]: In the last several years, activists like Greta Thunberg have become media stars and household names; national news outlets have ramped up their coverage of climate campaigns; and politicians have become increasingly outspoken about how environmental issues affect policy decisions. The surge in awareness of environmental issues can largely be attributed to the influence of grassroots movements.\n[4]: Grassroots Movements and Systemic Change: Investing in Grassroots Systemic Climate Solutions \u00b7 As part of our learning and evaluation process, we employed an Outcome Harvesting methodology to learn how our grassroots movement partners are advancing systemic and policy change to address the climate crisis.\n[5]: Grassroots innovations emerge as networks generating innovative solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation. However, it is unclear if gras\u2026\n[6]: The effects of climate change are devastating, and more people are joining the fight to combat this global issue. Nonprofit organisations and grassroots groups are constantly working with local communities to bring changes to environmental problems the public faces.

Discussions covered the importance of grassroots movements and community engagement in influencing policy change, urban planning for sustainable transportation, international cooperation efforts, the role of national governments in driving global cooperation, and mobilizing communities towards sustainable practices. Examples and case studies were shared to highlight successful initiatives and strategies in each of these areas.\n\nAvailable information: \n[1]: The community group has created the first mangrove carbon credit market in the world \u2014 meaning people or organizations pay for credits that are then used for mangrove restoration. So far, 117 hectares of mangroves have been protected. Mangroves are some of the most powerful natural mitigators of climate change in the world.\n[2]: This Primer aims to emphasize the potential role of blockchain technology in assisting a transition to a sustainable society through shedding light on the rationale behind blockchains, their core properties, and the available variants to get started. The article also conveys the main challenges impeding blockchain technology from attaining its full potential. Therefore, we encourage researchers, professionals, and enthusiasts from different sectors to continue exploring blockchains and investigate their potential for multidisciplinary applications while raising awareness about the considerate and wise use of this technology.\n[3]: That\u2019s what the Equator Initiative looks for \u2014 grassroots groups working to improve their habitats for the greater good.\n[4]: Among all recently developed technologies, blockchain (distributed ledger) has significant effects on the sustainability (Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018). Blockchain is a distributed accounting system with automatic transaction execution, which is used to maintain the growing data (Wu et al., 2017).\n[5]: This study addressed the diffusion (i.e. replication) of grassroots innovations in different contexts, and included both active and non-active (i.e. discontinued) initiatives in the Transition Movement, to allow for a comparison between the two.\n[6]: Perishable foods, vaccines, and cold supply chains require this disruptive technology to control the wastage of food and temperature-controlled pharmaceutical products (\u00d3skarsd\u00f3ttir and Oddsson, 2019).

While advancements in information technology have significantly improved various facets of the supply chain, supply chain visibility still lags in tracking and tracing capabilities.\n[9]: With objectives closely aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, Bridges to Prosperity (B2P) envisions a world where poverty caused by rural isolation no longer exists.

In addition to contributing to low-carbon creative programs, initiatives, campaigns, and communications, Julie\u2019s Bicycle developed The Creative Industry Green Tools, a set of free online carbon calculators. These calculators allow creative productions to measure their environmental impact, such as energy use and waste. ... A grassroots network of more than 180 international organizations and 200 million farmers, La Via Campesina, fights for food sovereignty and better management of the world\u2019s resources.\n[12]: Green blockchain technology is an enabler for sustainability management, and it is an inevitable need for future development that mediates the relatio\u2026\n[13]: But what does sustainable development really entail? And how can local governments harness the power of their community to spark real, tangible change?\n[14]: In addition, the study reviews the relevant regulatory environment related to ESG, including SDGs, IPCC, COP 27, ESMA, ISSB, SEC, GRI, TCFD, ESRS, IFRS S1 and S2 and CRSD. Most papers do not outline a structured approach to applying blockchain in the emerging regulatory environment.\n[15]: \u201cMany countries have been mainstreaming the SDGs into their planning documents or sustainable development policies. Many local governments have taken the initiative to implement the SDGs systematically, in some cases going further than national governments,\u201d noted Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The Forum also showed that communities are driving change.\n[16]: Blockchain energy measurements are currently heterogenous, unable to be compared and provide varying results.\n[17]: Learn more about work of Amara and others to erode the economic power of the fossil fuel industry and champion real climate solutions: Learn More \u00b7 Shibayan Raha, our senior digital organiser in South Asia, is always looking for engaging ways to foster people power. One of these efforts is in helping to build a strong movement for a Green New Deal in Bangladesh, which supports local communities and climate defenders in their efforts to persuade the government to walk away from dirty fossil fuels, and move towards a more just and equitable renewable energy future.\n[18]: We argue that there is a need to establish governance organizations that would provide platforms for debate and knowledge exchange, and for moving toward a common framing of the definitions, norms and standards essential to wider adoption of Blockchain Technology. In 2017 development aid flows by the OECD countries accounted for over 415 billion US dollars (OECD, 2019).\n\nLast utterance in the conversation: \nAbsolutely! Grassroots movements and community engagement initiatives are vital in tackling climate change and promoting sustainable development. For instance, 350.org is a great example of a global grassroots climate movement that mobilizes people for climate action. Local nonprofits and grassroots groups also play a crucial role in working with communities to implement sustainable changes. These initiatives push for systemic and policy changes to combat the climate crisis. Moreover, community engagement is key in driving sustainable development initiatives that meet local needs and aspirations, leading to environmental conservation and social equity. Projects in places like Stirling and Chile show how community-driven efforts can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. It's evident that individuals and organizations involved in sustainability efforts can make a significant impact in promoting environmental responsibility and social progress. Involving local communities in sustainable development projects is not just beneficial, but essential in driving meaningful change towards a more sustainable future.\n\nNow give next discussion focus in the format of one sentence question:",

And how can local governments harness the power of their community to spark real, tangible change?\\n[14]: In addition, the study reviews the relevant regulatory environment related to ESG, including SDGs, IPCC, COP 27, ESMA, ISSB, SEC, GRI, TCFD, ESRS, IFRS S1 and S2 and CRSD. Most papers do not outline a structured approach to applying blockchain in the emerging regulatory environment.\\n[15]: \\u201cMany countries have been mainstreaming the SDGs into their planning documents or sustainable development policies. Many local governments have taken the initiative to implement the SDGs systematically, in some cases going further than national governments,\\u201d noted Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The Forum also showed that communities are driving change.\\n[16]: Blockchain energy measurements are currently heterogenous, unable to be compared and provide varying results.\\n[17]: Learn more about work of Amara and others to erode the economic power of the fossil fuel industry and champion real climate solutions: Learn More \\u00b7 Shibayan Raha, our senior digital organiser in South Asia, is always looking for engaging ways to foster people power. One of these efforts is in helping to build a strong movement for a Green New Deal in Bangladesh, which supports local communities and climate defenders in their efforts to persuade the government to walk away from dirty fossil fuels, and move towards a more just and equitable renewable energy future.\\n[18]: We argue that there is a need to establish governance organizations that would provide platforms for debate and knowledge exchange, and for moving toward a common framing of the definitions, norms and standards essential to wider adoption of Blockchain Technology. In 2017 development aid flows by the OECD countries accounted for over 415 billion US dollars (OECD, 2019).\\n\\nLast utterance in the conversation: \\nAbsolutely! Grassroots movements and community engagement initiatives are vital in tackling climate change and promoting sustainable development. For instance, 350.org is a great example of a global grassroots climate movement that mobilizes people for climate action. Local nonprofits and grassroots groups also play a crucial role in working with communities to implement sustainable changes. These initiatives push for systemic and policy changes to combat the climate crisis. Moreover, community engagement is key in driving sustainable development initiatives that meet local needs and aspirations, leading to environmental conservation and social equity. Projects in places like Stirling and Chile show how community-driven efforts can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. It's evident that individuals and organizations involved in sustainability efforts can make a significant impact in promoting environmental responsibility and social progress. Involving local communities in sustainable development projects is not just beneficial, but essential in driving meaningful change towards a more sustainable future.\\n\\nNow give next discussion focus in the format of one sentence question:\"}]}"

When it comes to leveraging blockchain technology for environmental initiatives, there are indeed numerous opportunities and challenges to consider. Blockchain can enhance transparency by providing a secure and decentralized platform for recording and verifying transactions in real-time [1]. This can be particularly beneficial in tracking the impact of donations and funding in grassroots projects, ensuring accountability and trust among stakeholders [2]. However, challenges such as scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory concerns need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of blockchain in sustainable development [3]. Overall, integrating blockchain technology in grassroots environmental initiatives has the potential to revolutionize how we monitor and drive positive change for a more sustainable future.",

If this is the case, international cooperation should be the obvious pathway to address this collective problem. However, international cooperation has so far obtained modest results, as global temperatures and fossil fuel emissions continue to rise globally despite years of negotiations aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.\n[2]: As we face this global emergency, the need for international cooperation has never been greater. \ud83d\udc49 In this article, we\u2019ll explore why working together is the only viable solution to combating climate change. We\u2019ll uncover how global partnerships, shared technologies, and joint climate policies are already making an impact - and why isolationist approaches fall short in addressing the scale of the crisis.\n[3]: The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) stands as a critical global framework, fostering international collaboration to address the pressing issue of climate change. Through its agreements and protocols, the UNFCCC provides a platform for nations to collectively work toward reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapting to the changing climate, emphasising the essential role of global cooperation in combating this multifaceted challenge.\n[4]: Tackling Climate Change Goal 13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It is intrinsically linked to all 16 of the other Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To address climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.\n[5]: Thirty-five years ago, in Montreal, Canada, world leaders came together to make a landmark agreement to protect the ozone layer. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is now considered the most successful international environmental treaty ever, and an inspiring example of global cooperation to protect life on Earth.\n[6]: Home > Climate Box Toolkit > Climate Box Textbook > 3.

We continue to recognise the unique contributions of Indigenous Peoples, women and girls, persons with disabilities, and youth in climate change action. Australia continues to work with Pacific island Countries in bidding to host COP31 in 2026 to accelerate global climate action and to bring profile to the climate impacts in our region.\n[9]: Nairobi/ Geneva, 26 February \u2013 The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is calling for strengthened global cooperation in addressing climate-induced migration as world leaders convene for the sixth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA). \u201cAs leaders and decision makers gather at UNEA to set the global environmental agenda, let us not forget the plight of those forced to move due to climate and environmental factors,\u201d said IOM Chief of Staff Mohammed Abdiker.\n[10]: It solidifies international cooperation for climate change. It provides a way forward. The Paris Agreement sends a powerful signal to markets that now is the time to invest in the low emission economy. It contains a transparency framework to build mutual trust and confidence. It will serve as an important tool in mobilizing finance technological support and capacity building for developing countries. And it will also help to scale up global efforts to address and minimize loss and damage from climate change.\n[11]: Click on any specific Goal below to learn more about each issue and take action. Economic growth must be inclusive to provide sustainable jobs and promote equality. ... The food and agriculture sector offers key solutions for development, and is central for hunger and poverty eradication.\n[12]: This is the goal of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Several successful examples highlight the impact of these efforts on local and global levels.\n\nOne notable example is the work of 350.org, a grassroots organization dedicated to transitioning away from fossil fuels towards a clean and just future. By connecting powerful climate movements worldwide, 350.org has been instrumental in raising awareness and driving policy change.\n\nAnother impactful initiative is the creation of the world's first mangrove carbon credit market by a community group. This innovative approach allows individuals and organizations to support mangrove restoration by purchasing credits, ultimately leading to the protection of 117 hectares of mangroves. Mangroves are essential natural mitigators of climate change, making this project a significant contribution to sustainability efforts.\n\nAdditionally, the Equator Initiative identifies and supports grassroots groups that work towards improving their environments for the greater good. By recognizing and empowering these community-led initiatives, the Equator Initiative helps drive positive change and foster sustainable development practices.\n\nThese case studies demonstrate the power of grassroots movements and community engagement in influencing climate-related policy, fostering systemic change, and advancing sustainable development goals. By highlighting these successful examples, we can inspire further action and collaboration to address the pressing challenges of climate change.",

This landmark agreement stands as the most successful international environmental treaty to date, showcasing the power of unified efforts in safeguarding the Earth's vital ozone layer.\n\nFurthermore, the Paris Agreement has emerged as a significant step towards solidifying international cooperation for climate change mitigation[87]. This accord not only signals a clear message to global markets to invest in low-emission technologies but also sets a transparency framework to foster mutual trust and confidence among nations. Moreover, the Paris Agreement plays a crucial role in mobilizing financial resources, technological assistance, and capacity-building support for developing countries, emphasizing the collective responsibility in addressing climate challenges.\n\nAustralia's active involvement in international partnerships to combat climate change provides another example of successful global cooperation[86]. By prioritizing full and diverse participation in climate processes, including Indigenous Peoples, women and girls, persons with disabilities, and youth, Australia demonstrates a commitment to inclusive and sustainable climate action. Additionally, Australia's collaboration with Pacific island Countries to bid for hosting COP31 in 2026 showcases a proactive approach to accelerating global climate efforts and highlighting regional climate impacts.\n\nThese examples underscore the significance of international cooperation in addressing climate change comprehensively, emphasizing the shared responsibility and collective action needed to achieve a sustainable future for all.",
